Looking around, it would seem the natural endurance of most of the dragonettes had been mostly spent by now, and Tom had to admit it actually looked like it could be quite romantic to dance on dragon back on a fire lit night. 'Go get her, tiger,' he mused to himself as he put on Orinoco Flow, hoping to set the mood, so to speak. Not to mention, that was probably more up Unkai's street. If nothing else, it should slow Jarix down a little. Even if Unkai probably didn't have any qualms when Fengi fell over onto him, or needed 'rescue' from a precarious position.
It seemed to do the trick, as Fengi quickly set about figuring out some new dance moves for the calm song. Unkai was positively beaming as she leaned her head into him, dancing close and slow. While Jarix struggled to figure out what to do now, Tiguan just kept going on as if the music hadn't changed, with Ray very politely trying to get him to calm down, to little effect.
Tom watched them for a bit, feeling quite pleased with himself before someone tapped him on the shoulder. Jacky picked him up as he turned around, nuzzling him closely, not speaking as she slowly started almost waltzing while carrying him around.
"Is this like a traditional dance?" Tom questioned, kissing the side of her neck.
"Nah… I just know you can't dance for shit."
"Hey, we were just dancing like a few minutes ago, and since when do you dance like this?" Tom chuckled as she rubbed her head against him.
"Ever since I wanted to… and looking like a happy idiot doesn't count."
"Well, I won't complain," Tom replied, getting a bit more comfortable, his thighs resting on her hips as she held him. "This is quite nice."
"And I'm not even that drunk."
"I am," Tom chuckled in response, the two of them just enjoying themselves. He spied Saph and Maiko getting all chummy on the dance floor too.
Tom had almost hoped Grevi would have joined the boys on the dance floor. She was busy chatting it up with Glira though. Major Latori had given Lady Deriva a dance or two before the old lady had needed a rest.
Tom had really been enjoying it, but inevitably he felt Jacky start to grow restless with all the calm movements. She had put him down after the first song, with Tom just doing his best to copy those he could see around him and not step on her feet. It helped that Jacky had the strength to mostly fix his mistakes for him, but he didn't think he was doing half bad.
"Come on, spit it out. Whatcha thinking?" Tom questioned, eyes closed, head leant against her chest. Jacky's head rested atop his as they danced.
"I don't know… Maybe I should see how high I can throw you again."
"I can't have you all worn out already. Save your strength," Tom replied, with a little chuckle.
"Fine…" Jacky went, clearly thinking over how else they could have a little fun before it was time to call it a night. "Wanna see how far up Jarix's neck we can get before he throws us off?" Jacky went, pulling her head back to look down at him.
Tom did quite like that idea. If nothing else, it gave him an excuse to go climbing on Jarix. Looking at the blue, Unkai and Fengi were nowhere to be seen anymore. The dragon was just standing there, swaying in sync with the music.
"First to touch a horn gets to start on top tonight." Tom snickered at his not so subtle insinuation.
"Fucking deal," Jacky went, letting go of him in a heartbeat and running off towards Jarix. 'That might have been a tactical error,' Tom mused to himself, setting off after her. 'I guess I need to call in a favor then.' "Hey Jarix, don't let her touch your horn!"
"What? Why?" the dragon replied, looking confused.
"Just keep her down. It's a bet," Tom laughed out as Jacky was already clambering up Jarix's leg. 'Why didn't she just fly… Oh Jacky.'
"Shoo… no… shoo..."
"That's cheating," Jacky cried out as Jarix tried shaking her off, Jacky letting out a truly hilarious sound as she tried in vain to protest, her progress coming to an end.
"Yeah, get her Jarix," Tom laughed as he clambered up the dragon. Jacky seemingly found renewed purpose as she started moving up Jarix's leg despite the dragon shaking her harder, cursing all the way. "Ahr shit. Hey Jarix, could you be a good friend and reach a horn down here?"
"Hmmm…. Nah, I've helped enough" Jarix replied, laughing evilly at Tom's dwindling hope.
Tom did make it to the base of Jarix's neck before he felt a clawed hand grab his leg. "Come here, little boy," Jacky snarled at him.
"I'm doomed," Tom squeaked looking up at Jarix.
"Yup," Jarix replied helpfully with the kind of expression you give a friend when his girl just found out where he actually is. Then Tom was grabbed around the waist and lifted off Jarix's back by a large black foot, the long slender claws reaching nearly all the way around his waist. Jacky didn't let go of Tom's leg though, so Tiguan decided to shake Tom like a dog with a chew toy. Tom heard himself let out some rather funny noises as the world went all funny around the edges of his vision. At least Jacky had grabbed onto both of his legs, which did make it hurt less, but eventually she let go with an annoyed grunt.
"And the winner is!" Tiguan went, more or less just holding Tom against Jarix's head. Tom wasn't exactly feeling well anymore as he reached a shaky hand out to touch Jarix's horn. "Hurray!" Tiguan cheered out before putting Tom on top of Jarix's head with a little pat on the back. It was a rather precarious position,  but at least there were some hand holds.
"It's fun up here," Ray piped up, waving at Tom, who waved back a little weakly.
"Hi Ray… just need a minute."
"Fucking cheaters the lot of you," Jacky protested, having given up after she was shook off. She was currently sitting on Jarix's back, sulking.
"Tigs, why did you put him there?" Jarix questioned as Tom did his best to try and get comfy, which more or less just resulted in him doing a Kiran impersonation on top of Jarix's head.
"Ray said he looked sad and guessed he wanted to go up…"
"Sorry."
'Fuck that's right… nightvision,' Tom cursed to himself, just giving Jarix a pat on the side of the head. "I feel like Kiran right now."
"Does that make me Tom?"
"Sure. So big blue Tom, how do you plan on saving the world?"
"I will talk nonsense for three hours and in three different languages when I'm mad,then poop out something ranging from a weapon to change the world to a black writing stick," the dragon replied without missing a beat. "Oh, and say '*Fuck*' a lot."
"Oi! Din nare røv!" Tom countered with a chuckle.
"Tigs, do you know a language we can curse him in?" Jarix questioned, clearly annoyed at not understanding the insult.
"Tlar rok!" the black dragon replied, lifting a foot and pointing at Tom.
"You just said some gibberish didn't you?" Jarix questioned, Tom having to hang on as his head tilted.
'Fuck, this is trickier than it looks. How is Kiran so relaxed up here? This is a stressful environment...'
"Hey Tigs, wanna go have some fun?" Jarix questioned with a rather uncharacteristically evil chuckle.
"Uhh yeah," Tiguan replied, nodding enough that Ray let out a cry of alarm. "Shit, sorry."

Okay it was official, Saph was having a great time. Just drunk enough to want to stay on the dance floor. Just sober enough not to crush Maiko's feet. Maiko was really good at this. He had looked as much of an idiot as the rest of them during Tom's little outburst of… whatever that had been, but there was no denying the guy could dance. Saph was not much for dancing normally, but this was good fun.
Essy's song had been amazing, the drinks were great, the food was awesome, and they were having so much fun that she didn't even want to think about all the shit that was going on. 'Shit, I'm thinking about it…. Where's the mug?' "Hey Maiko, want another round?"
"Careful now, you sure you want to get this drunk?" the corporal questioned, not letting go of her.
"I'm not that wasted… You must be even worse than me, little mister scrawny."
"If you say so. We could also call it for the night. Quite a few people seem to have gone to bed, unless you want in on whatever they are doing over there?" Maiko went, gesturing at Jarix and Tiguan, who were definitely having a party.
"Nah… I think I want it a little slower right now. You know… enjoy the moment," she went, nuzzling up against him. She could feel him holding her a little tighter, letting out the tiniest little purr. 'Yeah, yeah, I know,' Saph mused to herself as the two of them kept dancing. That was a good question though… How much of a test period should she give him… He was being very nice. Everything she'd seen would seem to indicate he really did love her. Well of course he did, she was fucking awesome. But that left the question… What to do? They had been dancing for quite a while, yet he hadn't even tried to put a hand on her ass or anything like that. 'I guess I did set some rather strict rules to start with,' Saph relented. 'Maybe just a little more leeway...'
She let her hands glide down his upper arms to his elbows, and she guided his hands down a bit lower, then a little lower still. It was such a strange feeling to have a pair of hands gliding over a spot that was normally so sacred. To have someone hold her there of all places was so… different.
'By the gods, you have gotten uptight, haven't you?' she chuckled to herself leaning into him, her hands going back up to start fondling his ears a little. The corporal seemed to just stand there even as they kept slowly waltzing, until his hands finally started moving again and slowly caressing her back.
"You having fun?" Saph asked after a bit.
"Oh yeah," came the simple reply as he let a hand run down her thigh.
"Hmm… maybe here isn't the best place for this… Would you prefer somewhere more private… or maybe out under open sky?"
"I think you would look good in moonlight."
"Stop it you," she went, giving him a playful shunt and trying not to giggle. "Fine, come on then. Or are you too lovestruck to walk?"
"If I say yes, will you carry me?"
"I might," she teased, pulling her head back to look at him appraisingly.
"Pretty please?"
Saph didn't answer, just picking the guy up with a sigh and carrying him off. She didn't want to go too far anyway, just around to the other side of the keep and out into the long grass past the bunker should be fine.
"Now don't you dare pinch me. I have no intention of waking up right now," Maiko went, looking around to check they were out of sight of the party before he got as cozy as he could in her arms, purring away as they disappeared into the dark.
"Now why would I wanna do that?" Saph said, having a nibble on one of his ears, making sure it hurt just a little.
"Stop it you. Oi stop it!" Maiko protested, squirming a little in her arms. "I get it, I get it."
"Then say it," Saph snickered before continuing her little assault.
"I ain't dreaming."
"Oh on the contrary, where we're going it's gonna get quite dreamy." 'Fucking hell, Saph. Why did you say that?'
"What kind of dream then?" Maiko questioned as Saph found a nice thick patch of grass, sitting down with him on her lap.
"I haven't quite figured that out yet. Why don't we start with a little star gazing?"
"Which stars? There are some up there and one right here I think."
"Waow… I thought I was pushing it," Saph snickered, laying down into the grass with her wings folded out to make it more comfortable, patting the ground to her right.
Maiko laid down, scooting up against her as they looked up into the mostly clear sky. There were plenty of stars tonight and a little bit of a moon with the odd cloud here and there. Saph let out a deep sigh.
Soon it would be too cold to do anything like this at night. Right now, though, she felt as comfy as ever looking up at the sky.
"You know, Essy told me you had tried to get into the guard when you were younger."
"What of it? I didn't get in."
"Exactly… Most people are mad when they don't make it in."
"I mean, they made it pretty clear they didn't want some pretty girl racer who thought she was tough enough to fight for a living, and I didn't have money to persuade them with, so to speak."
"Ever thought about trying again?"
"Sure, plenty of times. I was mad at them though, and I wanted to show them I didn't need them to become the best."
"Well, you are already the best looking, a champion, and definitely one of the best archers I've ever seen. You can take a joke, and, by Itova, have I told you how good you look?"
"Next up my eyes shall receive a compliment, I think."
"Nah, that's too basic even for me."
"Oh come on, you're a city boy and a witty boy, get it?" Saph went, jostling his side a little.
"And a pretty boy."
"If you say so," Saph repleid with a chuckle, Maiko feigning insult.
"I would have you know I am considered most attractive."
"Is it the lean build and smallish frame that has likely allowed you to wiggle into a lot of places you weren't allowed to go?"
"Hell yeah it is. Well that and my winning personality."
"Yeah, how the hell did you end up in the Royal Guard of all places? You haven't said much about your life before that."
"I guess not. Well what is there to say? Mum and dad were both lancers. They don't tend to live that long."
Saph had heard of the lancers. Those guys were somewhere between the bravest and dumbest people you could find pretty much anywhere. And they were the people you called when you needed to kill a dragon but didn't have one to do it for you.
"Mum died when I was little. Dad lasted long enough to see me into the guard. He wanted them to 'shape me up' as he called it. I had gotten a bit too good at running away from whatever they wanted to have me do."
"Maiko, the rebellious teenager? Oh I've gotta hear this."
"Well, what is there to say? My parents were all rules and strict discipline and I… wasn't. Dad got me into a good school, and we lived in a nice house. I had a lot of friends."
"I'm guessing you were the cool kid."
"Hell yeah, I had money, and I didn't give a crap. We just hung out and had some fun. Then I fell behind in school, stirred up trouble a few to many times, dad got angry yada yada yada. In the end he decides that if he couldn't raise me, the guard could. Let me tell you. Me in basic. That was not nice. Every officer soon had it out for me. I'm sure my dad didn't help on that front. I even had to live on the base, that was so fucking annoying."
"And all that 'winning personality' was stripped away never to be seen again?" Saph chuckled before letting him carry on.
"I'm still me, I'll always be me. As soon as I got out of basic, I learned real fast that if you're useful you can get away with a lot. Like really a lot."
"So what did you do then, aside from escorting girls in the capital that made you so useful?"
"Victoria often used me to mingle with the new recruits. I'm just a corporal, after all. When working with dragon crews, almost all of them outrank me. I'm not scary to them, so it's easy to become their friend."
"You sly little bastard. Let me guess, your magic somehow makes people like you?"
"No, but it can make people not see me."
"What, so you turn into Tom for a bit?"
"Nope, people just don't notice me. It's quite weird. They can see me just fine… they just don't care."
"That's actually… I don't think I've heard of that before."
"It's not that common. Neither is your little trick, that's quite something."
"Oh shush, there are quite a few out there like me, and you know it. Sure, they might not be as good as me..."
"Oh no, of course not," Maiko replied, piling on the sarcasm.
"Are you questioning my immense skill with a bow, My little warrior?" Sapphire questioned, pulling a sly little grin.
"Oh, I'm yours now?" Maiko deflected, taking his eyes off the sky and looking to Saph instead, snuggling up with her a little tighter.
"I think I'll take you. If you are still up for grabs that is?" Saph replied, looking at him with an inquisitive glare.
"All yours…" the corporal let out, Saph being able to feel his heart speeding up and his breathing quicken a little. "Does this mean I don't have to sleep on the floor anymore?" he asked, clearly trying to remain cool.
"I guess so," she confirmed with a smile. "If you behave yourself. Sounds like I have to give you something to lose to keep you in check, my little rebel."
"I can agree to these terms."
***
There were apparently rules against drunk flying but not running. So Tom had gotten a beer relay up, and he was running with those that were still standing. There weren't that many, to be honest. They did still have all four of the walking tanks still going though, and both Tiguan and Jarix seemed quite sad at only being able to watch… They couldn't have that.
Tom had presented his little idea for a race that would include their four largest individuals. Glira had been in as soon as Jarix made a bet against her. Grevi had been convinced by the two guys collectively agreeing that she had no chance because she was so damn slow.
Dakota had stopped them from doing anything too crazy near the keep since some people had gone to bed by now. So off they had gone, every dragon speckled with torches from those that had decided to come along as they trotted into the dark in a line. Major Jortun had agreed to keep an eye on the lot of them, Glira taking the lead.
It was quite the merry band they had put together, though Tiguan seemingly decided it was a bit quiet as they walked.
"Hey everyone, why is Jarix so good?"
"Please no, Tiguan…" Jarix let out, sounding like depression was imminent.
"He's very talonted!" Tiguan finished, seeming very proud of himself, though the feeling didn't seem mutual.
"Oh god," Tom cursed.
"What do you call someone trying to board a dragon mid flight?" Glira then went.
"A snack!" her entire crew and all the dragons answered in unison with varying levels of exasperation.
"Heh snack," Tom went to himself as he heard Jarix audibly sigh, a slight feeling of butterflies in his stomach as the dragon dropped his head a little in shame.
"Oh come on, it wasn't that bad…. What's Baron's favorite cut of meat?" Tom tried, really liking this little game.
"Please Tom… I like you."
"*Flaming yawn*."
"... I don't get it," Jarix replied after a bit of a think break. Everyone else also just looked at Tom weirdly. "I guess that one doesn't translate… How do you tell what a dragon weighs then?... It comes with scales!"
Jarix did actually chuckle ever so slightly at that one, and a few other likely very drunk people cheered loudly.
"Fine, I'll do one… When we saved Deriva Keep it was quite the blast," Jarix went, seeming to regret that one as soon as it was out his mouth. "I'm sorry."
"My will to live is dra-gone," Grevi went, clearly not proud of herself either.
"Right, halt here," Major Jortun went, standing up on Glira's back to look back at them all. "You two boys," he said, gesturing to Junior and Radexi. "You stay here. Mark the finish line with these two torches. You and your two sweethearts are in charge of having the drinks ready." They did as the major said, and Bolinda and Phospheno went to follow the two rascals. The four of them got a keg from Glira's harness as well as a bunch of mugs."
"Rules are simple; we are going for night maneuvers… on the ground, while two of you are drunk…  I think you trained in this at some point if not tell Baron he missed a spot." The major was clearly having fun, probably also having had a decent go at the drinks department. "Three person crews. We'll go down there a bit and mark a startline, then it's a race back and forth once. You can't leave this end before your crew has finished drinking. Was that right?" The major questioned, looking at Tom who just gave a thumbs up as he checked the two torches he had tied to Jarix's horns… just because, you know.
"Right, pick your crews."
"I want the crazy inventor guy. He's fun. You can drink too, Jortun. Who else…" Glira went, looking around. She still had most of her crew to pick from, so was spoiled for choice really. "Twitch, you have decent constitution."
Jarix looked down at Zarko and Jacky on his back, seemingly content. "I got my crew: Zarko, Tom, Jacky."
"I'll take Ray, Luke, and Rekui," Tiguan went, nodding to himself.
"Well, I'm winning today. Shiva, Anchor, and Raulf," Grevi spoke up, seeming rather pleased with her choice. Her only remaining crew member got off to watch instead. "And no, you may not sit on my head. Just try not to fall off."
"You better not fall off up there," Jarix went to Tom, testing his grip by tilting his head side to side.
"I'm on here tight, believe me," Tom replied looking over at the ground, only visible through the flicker of torchlight.
"Awesome. This is gonna be great," Jarix let out as Tom felt him hunker down. "Right one more… What do you do with a green dragon?" The dragon tried again as Tom felt Grevi's head turn to look at them. "You wait until it's ripe!"
"Jarix… Run," Grevi snarled at the two of them.
Jarix wasted no time getting moving. Tom struggled to hold on as the dragon kicked off hard enough that Tom guessed they had just dug a pair of trenches. Glira was also quick off the line, probably having seen that one coming, but the larger blue fell behind a little, clearly not able to match the young ones out of the hole. Tiguan was a little slow to catch on, but he got the memo in the end, and he was soon bounding across the open fields at quite some speed.
Looking ahead, Tom could see absolutely nothing. Just blackness. He really hoped Jarix could see a bit more than him right now since they were going quite fast as the dragon seemed to reach a full gallop, his powerful legs pounding away at the ground beneath them. They were in first place, but Grevi had made it up onto their side, looking at Jarix with murderous intent.
"Why is Jarix such a coward in battle?" Grevi shouted out with an almost evil cackle in her voice. "He's got no charge!"
"Oh fuck off," Jarix cursed to himself but Tom heard him.
"What comes next will shock you!" Grevi replied with a sarcastic chuckle.
"Shut up you crazy bitch."
"You got a poisonous personality!" Tom fired back, laughing like a maniac.
"When I'm done with you I'll be charged with abuse of power!" Glira cackled as she went galloping past them all on the left. The massive dragon was running like a damn cheetah or something, sending dirt spraying everywhere to the point Tom took cover not to catch a chunk in the face. Looking back down at Jarix's back, he too was going hell for leather, Zarko and Jacky hanging on for dear life.
In the darkness behind them Tom saw a rather unsettling sight; the black form of Tiguan was all but invisible except for the torchlight shining in his eyes, the people on him probably having dropped their torches. He looked damn scary even to Tom, but he knew in proper lighting he would probably have his tongue flapping in the wind grinning like a happy puppy right now.
Looking back ahead and thinking happy thoughts he saw the finishing line approaching fast, Glira already fighting to slow down, Jarix holding off a little longer. Tom held on for all he was worth as Jarix slammed on the brakes, the eight ton dragon skidding on all fours, Tom picking a horn to hold onto clinging to it like a child to it's mother on public transport.
"Quick quick quick," Jarix went as Tom felt himself go first weightless, then into negative G, and then an abrupt halt as Jarix laid his head on the ground rather hard. Tom stumbled off a touch disoriented towards the row of ale mugs somewhat ready to do his duty.
"Well hello, old friend," Tom went, picking up a mug and starting to chug. Thanks to Jarix's little assist he was the first to get going. Jacky and Zarko were close behind as Tiguan came skidding in too, Ray getting the same ride Tom had gotten, though she cheered like she was on a rollercoaster or something.
Jacky still beat him to the finish, but it was a close thing as Tom clambered back into Jarix's face. Jacky used her wings to make her way up Jarix's left foreleg. The dragon was it holding as a ramp for her this time rather than trying to shake her off. Zarko was a little slower, but not too terrible, and their team finished first. Grevi was not far behind though, Shiva and Raulf shouting at Anchor to hurry it up.
Glira lost precious time simply because it took more time to get on and off her, and the Major was not exactly quick either. The guy seeming quite sloshed already.
"Right, we got a small lead out of that, up to you now," Tom went, doing his best to get comfy while not falling off as Jarix set off again back the way they came. Only now looking ahead did Tom notice they were not exactly going straight, even if Jarix's head stayed rather level, he was swerving quite a lot. Whether that was due to him being drunk or just avoiding things Tom couldn't see he didn't quite know… Nor did he care. This was epic. "Yeee haaaaaw!"
"Hey, that's my line!" Jacky shouted out, sounding like she was trying to hold something down.
"Don't you dare puke on me," Jarix went, looking back. Tom involuntarily went along for the ride, and was now sorta going backwards.
"Shouldn't you be looking ahead?"
"I've been running befo-" Jarix went before Tom felt himself accelerate towards the ground at an appreciable velocity. Drunk as he was, his only concern was really the fact he hadn't actually wanted to be right this time around.
"Jarix you idi-" Tom shouted before Jarix's head slammed into the ground, knocking the wind out of Tom quite thoroughly. "Aoww," Tom squeaked out, trying to look up to decide whether he would just lie there for a bit focusing on trying to breathe. His sense of time kinda got a little fuzzy, but someone was certainly shaking him by the shoulders now… and he was on his back… in the grass.
"You okay? Come on, at least say something?"
"Bob," Tom replied, pulling a smile, very proud of his comedic timing as Jacky pulled him into an embrace from where she was sitting on her knees next to him.
"Oh you damn idiot. You had me worried there… Again!"
"Sorry," Tom chuckled, trying to get up, Jacky not letting him.
"You are staying right here, little guy," she went, holding him close.
"Congratulations. You didn't kill him. Well done," Glira went in a rather mocking tone. Tom just heard a grumble from his left, not really being able to look thanks to Jacky's iron embrace. "You break something, or did you actually get away with that?"
"I'm fine… head hurts a little, but I'm fine."
"So what did you learn?" Glira went, tone turning downright mocking.
"Look where I'm going?"
"Correct! That and you lost."
"Thanks, mum."

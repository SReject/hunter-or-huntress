"Yes we are here, by request of the king," Dakota went, presenting the paperwork to the guards. 'There was a sentence I never thought would be applicable to me', Sapphire thought to herself. It certainly changed the guard's tone, from "Halt who goes there," to "By all means come on in should I carry something for you?"
"This feels very strange," Balethon whispered to her as they were escorted through the gates from the landing platform into the Palace grounds proper. "I've never seen anything like this. Look there's fountains and everything."
"Do try and restrain yourself Balethon" Dakota sneered at him. They were supposed to represent the keep and so far that hadn't gone brilliantly. Sapphire could still feel the alcohol making her a tad unsteady, not to mention messing with her eyesight. She was also trying really hard not to find the absurdity of this situation funny when she should probably be terrified of messing up.
They had been assigned two female guards and a diplomat looking guy who would take them where they needed to go. The diplomat kindly took them through what they needed to know as they walked. Apparently, they were expected to take part in a light lunch followed by the meeting itself where they might be called upon to explain the situation at their keep. Sapphire didn't have any illusions as to whether they would be called upon. They wouldn't just call them up here if they didn't have a purpose for it, so Dakota was gonna have her work cut out for her.
They were walking up to a set of massive double doors, guards posted outside. "Here we are, The Council Building. Three guests for today's meeting," their escorting royal guard stated. Sapphire had tried her best to pay attention as they walked. There was just so much to look at. She guessed that looking around at all the amazing buildings made her seem like a rural simpleton, who was seeing the city for the first time.
The Council Building was located north of the main palace. She had hoped they would get to see the actual palace from the inside, but this was still amazing. The Council Building was a vast, squat building. Judging by the tall elegant windows there were four very tall floors inside. The massive doors swung open, revealing a massive corridor wide enough to let a grown dragon pass unhindered. The walls were polished marble as white as a newborn. There were even servants who wiped guests' feet as they entered. The floors were covered in thick, deep blue carpet. The sensation of walking on it was almost heavenly. Sapphire had never felt anything like it. The closest she had ever gotten was a nice grassy field.
Their escorts remained with them as they went deeper into the grand building. Sapphire's eyes floated over the countless paintings and tapestries. She hardly recognized any of them. She guessed Apuma was cursing her for that. It was mostly dragonettes and dragons of note, there was the odd exception though. A unicorn here and a few different creatures she didn't even recognize there.
"How familiar are you with The Council members?" The diplomat asked. Sapphire guessed he was, in fact, some kind of usher.
"Last time I set foot on the palace grounds I was ten," Dakota went in an apologetic tone.
"I see, well, I doubt you will have to address any of them without making your introductions first. Do try not to get it wrong though. If you're uncertain as to who you are addressing simply refer to them as 'Lord' or 'Lady.' " Dakota looked back at the two of them. Sapphire nodded, she could do that no problem. Hopefully, Balethon could remember that too.
"Thank you kindly. Also I do apologize for not being better prepared."
"Nothing to apologize for. Circumstances are strained. I doubt you are the only ones poorly prepared for the day's meeting."
"Did something bad happen?" Sapphire questioned.
"You mean, aside from several keeps, including yours, reporting Darkling sightings, some of them coming under attack from corrupted forces, and a detachment of royal guards sent to one going missing?"
"I'm sorry what?" Dakota interjected. "How many keeps!"
"I apologize. I do not know the finer details, but over the past month or so I think 8 keeps have reported sightings. We know 2 have in fact fallen, the fate of a further two is still unknown. Those are just the attacks we know of. Though I cannot tell you why this meeting is being called since this is hardly new information to the king." 'That certainly puts us being called here in a different light.' Sapphire thought. "I believe you are here so we may determine if you were attacked for the same reasons since you were the first target to our knowledge. Am I right in saying you were attacked a little over a month ago?"
"Yes, that is correct," Dakota replied. "5 weeks to be exact. They were after a dark artifact in a trader's possession."
"Well, I'm sure the council will be interested to hear what happened."
They were led to a large hall with finely decked tables,white table cloths, silver cutlery, and fine glasses were set and ready. People were standing around making conversation. Sapphire guessed there were between 40-50 people present with more arriving alongside themselves.
"You are seated over there next to the delegation from Kindal Keep. You will be called to the table when the food is ready. Restrooms are in there if you need them." The usher bowed politely before leaving to do whatever an usher did apart from dealing with people like them.
Balethon edged closer to Dakota, leaning in. "You weren't joking when you said high society," he tried to whisper, without much effect.
"This wasn't exactly what I had expected. Be on your very best behavior, do your best to act like the people around you, and we three stick together." Sapphire could see Dakota frantically scanning the room, likely looking for someone she knew.
"Any luck?" Sapphire questioned.
"No," came the perturbed sounding reply. "We're on our own I think."

Tom and Jackalope were bringing up the rear keeping an eye on Jarix, who was beating hard just to maintain altitude. Tom was hoping he would make it to the edge of the forest. It was clear though they were gonna need a break at some point.
Jackalope had been allowed to calm down for a few minutes following her outburst. She hadn't actually said anything apart from getting ready to speak a few times but saying nothing. Tom wasn't any better though, he had no clue what to say following all that. He was starting to wonder if this should go on the list of bad ideas... nevermind, it was definitely a bad idea. Could it work though? Eventually, she did appear to gather the courage to speak so at least he didn't have to break the silence.
"Sooo uhhmmm… Do I get to try the guns?" 'I should probably have seen that coming,' Tom thought to himself.
"I guess, sure."
"Yes," came the timid sounding reply. Followed by more silence. "Tom? What do you… humans talk about with someone you like a lot?" How the fuck was he supposed to answer that one? Dammit, he didn't know shit about this kind of thing.
"That's one hell of a question Jacky… Feelings I guess?" There was a bit more slightly awkward silence. He wasn't really sure if the feeling of uncomfortableness was coming from him or her, but it was definitely in the air.
"Well, you said 'I love you', so I guess 'I love you' too?" That was the least convincing, 'I love you,' Tom had ever heard. Her earlier outburst did lend it some validity though… He guessed. Perhaps he needed to set an example... Oh boy. 'Remember Unkai, don't just tell her she looks good…'
"Well, I like you because you are funny, and generally awesome." Hey, that wasn't too bad.
"Aww... I like you because you're brave, smart… ohh and warm" She sounded quite proud of coming up with that, shuffling her shoulders. Tom just chuckled a bit.
"Jacky, you're 32, right?"
"Yup."
"Have you ever... You know, loved someone?" That question was followed by yet more silence before she timidly answered.
"I haven't really been able to get it to work out. I did have a fling once… didn't end so well" 'Well, at least that made two of them,' Tom thought to himself. He was hardly what you would call experienced on the subject. His past endeavors had mostly been the result of wild partying rather than anything serious. "What about you?"
"No… not really" He admitted.
"That is fucking adorable." Jarix then decided to add mockingly. 'Goddamn dragons and their stupid ears,' Tom cursed to himself.
"Hey! I'm badass, not adorable. That's Kiran… or Fengi!" Jackalope replied in an irritated tone. Jarix just made an amused sounding rumble in reply.
"Try talking about the stuff you find interesting," Radexi of all people then added. Tom added potential Kokashi hearing to the list of what he could do. Though it was more likely he had just figured out they were being a little quiet.
"Hey, Tom, where do you need to shoot Jarix to bring him down?" Jackalope questioned, voice turning to mischievousness. Well, that was better than awkward silence. More to the point, it was something Tom could answer fairly well.
"Base of the skull just like the tirox, alternatively you could pump his side full of rounds. It would be much slower though."
"Hey!" Jarix protested. Head swinging around to look at them.
"We do need to get you some ear muffs though if you are gonna be shooting much. Can't have you going deaf on me."
"Wait, that can happen?" Jackalope replied in a worried tone. "I thought it just hurt?"
"No, you can lose your hearing forever and we can't have that, now can we?" He went grabbing a horn, rustling her head a bit.
"Hey stop it, or I'll poke you," She replied with a joking threat.
"Joke's on you, I have my goggles on."
"Ain't my fault you can't see shit otherwise."
"That is true. How far till you get too tired to carry me aloft on those mighty wings of yours?"
"Well, if you weighed the same as Herron, days. Unfortunately, you have more in common with a tirox."
"Are you calling me fat?"
"Nooo, just heavily built," she replied, laughing at her own joke.
"See, there you go," Radexi then shouted, though Tom thought that was directed at Fengi who was once again soaring above them.
'Perhaps it should be him rather than me trying to help Unkai,' Tom mused to himself.
"Hey, Jarix feeling tired yet?" Jackalope shouted out, looking at the dragon ahead of them.
"Nah not yet. How far is it?" Jarix replied. Tom reckoned he was trying to sound more confident than he was.
"Half an hour at most," Zarko responded.
"If anyone calls me lazy after this I'm zapping them" Tom could feel Jackalope tense up getting ready to speak. He just put a calming hand on her shoulder. In hindsight, he should have realized that would be insufficient.
"I'll race you to the treeline; the last one there is a lazy ass!"
"Now Jacky no need to..." Tom started.
"You're on, love bird!" Tom was about to object, but he had kinda known what he was signing up for here. Why not? It couldn't go any worse than some time spent camping in the woods until Jackalope recovered.  It might actually be educational as well.
"Right, let's beat his ass," Tom went, hunkering down.
"Hey, you're not the one working her ass off here."
"Well, I worked very hard for that kill on your opponent's back. It's only fair I get a break." He really hadn't, but it was the thought that counted.
"Is the parachute packed?" Jackalope questioned curiously.
"Yes?" Tom asked slightly perturbedly, feeling like he might need it. He instinctively checked where the cord was, just in case.
"Just checking," Jackalope went, turning her head just enough to show the evil grin on her face. Yeah, she held all the cards at the moment. Tom just hoped her pride wouldn't lead to another Kokashi situation.
The 'race' was not really much of an explosive start since they were already cruising. Jarix did put on some more speed though, Jackalope clearly struggling to keep up to stay in his wake. Tom had been in his current position enough times to recognize a tired dragonette when laying on top of one, and Jackalope had been doing some rather enthusiastic flying thus far. As good a time as any for an experiment then.
"Hey I wanna try something, now don't tell the others yet." Tom began to rifle through his pockets, as stealthily as possible. He knew he had brought some candy along, for emergency peace offerings. They had saved his ass once before so he considered them essential equipment. It had nothing to do with his own sweet tooth.
"Keeping secrets already?" Jackalope replied, seemingly finding that amusing even if she was working hard.
"Here shhh," He reached around to give her the candy. This stuff had worked wonders for Kiran, and they definitely loved the stuff. He wondered if he could get Jackalope a sugar high. As dangerous as that sounded.
"What's that? Ooh..."
"Remember, shush."
Jackalope just nodded in reply, opening her mouth. Tom had guessed she would just take it, but who was he to judge as he placed the candy in there. He had almost expected Jackalope to bite, it certainly felt like she was considering it.
"Dammit that tastes good," She went, clearly trying and failing to be quiet. Now the waiting game began, he wanted to see what just one would do before he upped the dosage, so to speak. Kiran had only gotten half a candy, but he weighed three, maybe four kilos tops in this gravity, even if he was growing fast. That would put the equivalent dose for Jackalope at around five candies.
It did feel like she perked up a little, though he couldn't decide if that was just from having something delicious to eat. So after a bit, he leaned into her ear. "Want another one?"
She turned her head around again to face him. Eyes darting around clearly searching for anyone who shouldn't know. "Pretty please?" She went looking at him, he guessed she was trying to imitate Fengi's signature puppy eyes. She wasn't really pulling it off though.
Tom felt like he was in some kind of corny chick flick mixed with the dude from Mad Max pouring gas down superchargers, as he put another candy into that toothy maw.
On the third candy the effect was becoming very apparent, she was picking up speed, wingbeats quickening. Her breathing was becoming more ragged though, much like Tom had expected.
"What is this stuff?" She let out between labored breaths, sounding almost incredulous.
"Candy," Tom truthfully replied. "Sugar does more than taste good. It would seem to work wonders for you people."
"This is amazing. I heard Sapphire bitch about people using honey for competitions, but damn."
"We are gonna need those sugar beets then. Might make you fast enough to catch Jarix," Tom chuckled.
"If you hadn't just given me... three of those things... you would be flying solo... right now... Maybe if I had another," Jackalope replied in a suggestive tone clearly struggling for breath. She wasn't slowing down though.
"Hey, that's not very nice. I believe that is called extortion where I'm from."
"Extorotikon," Jackalope tried and failed miserably.
"No no, you nearly got it."
"What the hell are you feeding her?" Zarko finally called out. Okay maybe they hadn't been that stealthy.
"Love and affection," Tom replied grinning. Zarko didn't comment on that, though Tom sincerely doubted she had been convinced by it.
"Are you cheating back there?" Jarix called out. Clearly breathing heavily too. The dragon's wing beats had slowed a little, though Tom wasn't sure if that was due to confidence they couldn't pass him or tiredness.
"No, my payload is just… more useful," Jackalope replied. They were maintaining distance for the moment or perhaps gaining a bit. Tom guessed that was likely due to the flying in Jarix's wake though.
"Dammit," Jarix replied, though he didn't speed up. Tom guessed he was fairly well aware of his own endurance then since he knew Jarix could go faster. Even if he didn't know how much that tirox was slowing him down.
"Just stay behind him, no use overtaking yet."
"I have done this before you know."
"With a dragon?"
"No."
Tom conceded that she was probably the more experienced of the two when it came to flying though, so he respectfully shut up.
The chase continued for a few minutes without any change in the situation. Radexi had fallen behind, though Fengi and Zarko were still keeping up. At the pace that they were making the edge couldn't be too far away, and the candy did seem to take a minute to work. "Up for the last sprint?" Tom questioned, bringing out two more candies. She was definitely starting to show signs of fatigue again, which was hardly surprising all things considered. It wasn't like this stuff could last forever.
He was a tad worried the sugar wouldn't do its job in her fatigued state. His fears were fairly quickly dispelled though as she once again picked up the pace closing in on the now definitely slowing Jarix.
"So how's it hanging?" Tom questioned. Jackalope was currently too busy panting, so the least he could do was provide the sass.
"Cheating bastards," Jarix got out, clearly struggling for breath. That gave Tom an idea.
"You never told me about your mother Jarix. She was the one who gave you your harness, Right?"
"Yes… it was a gift for... graduating…"
"What's her name?"
"Glira."
"Is she a trader like your father?"
"No… she"
"Stop it Jarix, he's playing with you," Zarko cut him off. 'Dammit woman,' Tom thought to himself. He had felt damn proud of that trick. Jarix for his part swiveled his head around at the two of them with a sour expression on his face.
"Sorry… I do wanna hear about her at some point," Tom tried. That had been a tad underhanded, he admitted. Jackalope for her part kept quiet, focusing on flying.
The tree line soon came into view and he felt Jackalope try to pick up more speed. She was flying right through Jarix' wake, which clearly helped a lot since as soon as she made a break for clean air she got buffeted back, losing ground.
Tom couldn't really see how she was going to win this. Even if she had been flying solo he guessed they were currently going faster than she could maintain in clean air and he knew how fast Jarix could dive.
"Dammit," Jackalope let out in a defeated tone. Tom did feel a little bad for just being a deadweight right about now. As they crested the trees Jarix went into a near-vertical dive, tucking in his wings. Tom knew from experience just how fast this was likely to get so he hung on tight.
Jackalope tried to follow Jarix down. She was quickly losing ground though even trying to beat her wings towards the ground as Jarix pretty much just fell out of the sky, in front of them.
"You ain't gonna catch him," Tom tried as they continued the dive.
Jackalope didn't reply though she did pull up.
As she slowed down for the landing she was clearly having trouble and mistimed the flare quite badly, resulting in them both hitting the ground with a light thunk coming to a sliding stop. Jarix was standing head held low, clearly spent as well. In fact, he looked ready to fall over, which he soon did. Rolling onto his side to get the weight off. Jackalope was not much better off. Tom got off her as soon as they were stationary again, feeling quite sorry for having her break his fall. It had not been too bad though and she was still breathing and looked fine, even if she was clearly spent for the moment.
It took a  bit before the others caught up, clearly not having been able to match either dive.
"Cheaters never prosper, how are you doing Jarix?" Zarko went as soon as she touched down.
"I feel like I could lay here for a week," He protested. "Could you please get me out of all this?"
'Please, yup, he's done.' ' Tom noted to himself.
"Sure thing," Fengi went, getting to work undoing the rope.
Tom just looked down at the mess that was Jackalope laying in the grass in front of him.
"Come here," He went, sitting down and picking her up into his lap. "You're damn right, Sapphire couldn't have done that." She did smile weakly at him, looking almost apologetic.

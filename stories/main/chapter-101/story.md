The next few days had passed mostly without incident, being broken only by messengers handing off a few things. They had received word that Tom was indeed on the mend and walking about by now. The reports of his physical condition weren't great, but his head at least seemed okay. He had grown rather weak in addition to developing a kind of trembling. Apparently, even drinking a glass of water without spilling was a challenge for him at the moment.
That was what the stuff sent with Tiguan was for though, and it sounded like Jarix would be back in the sky just in time for them all to meet up at home. Ray had been left in the caring hands of Haiko for the day as they were gonna be heading to the academy. They had rented a room for her, much to her protest. She claimed that she could sleep on the floor just fine. Dakota hadn't budged though, so she had her own room and they had all put together a little pocket change for her for drinks or whatever else she might fancy.
Maiko was following along as they made their way to the academy, his head still on a swivel all the way there. They had clearly been expected, the guard letting them inside and urging them to take a seat in the lobby at some rather nice tables and chairs.
It didn't take long before Linkosta came skipping into the large room. She beckoned them over with a hand wave as she turned to head wherever it was they were going. It wouldn't do to run in a place like this, but Linkosta was not slowing down for them, so it took a bit to catch up.
"My, you are in a hurry today?" Sapphire jested as she caught up.
"Yes, this is gonna be so exciting! Hopefully your guy doesn't pass out too soon. Do you think I can have a chat too?"
"I mean, I don't think we have even tried to put the earrings on him yet, have we?" Sapphire questioned, looking back to Dakota who was catching up too.
"No. It might not even work; in that case we will just get Nunuk to relay."
"How do yours work? Are they like talking to each other or more intimate? What about other senses? Can you see them?"
"Just talking, I'm afraid," Dakota interrupted, before the list of questions got too long.
"Aww beans, I was hoping for an in-depth look. Ishani promised to let me have a go at him. If he can take it of course."
"Well the dude doesn't sleep much and he just tends to keep going, so maybe?" Sapphire tried in reply. They knew nothing of Tom's magical abilities or endurance. Hell he might not even have any at all, but she guessed they were about to find out.
"Yes yes, I know. That's not the same and you know it," Linkosta dismissed her as they made their way up a few flights of stairs, eventually arriving at a rather innocuous-looking door, which Linkosta knocked on in code. Either that or she just hadn't given up the habit.
The door had swung open seemingly of its own accord. Linkosta stepped inside with a little skip.
"Right, they are here."
Stepping inside, it looked like some kind of personal suite; it didn't look an awful lot like an office, though there was a writing desk up against one of the walls. There were some comfortable-looking chairs and a single sofa, the rest of the space being taken up by a large workbench surrounded by shelves of odd items and jars of who knows what.
"Thank you, Linkosta. Please make yourselves comfortable," Lady Ishani replied, gesturing towards the seating, looking to all of them. "I heard Tom made it through."
"He's a little worse for wear, but they are confident he will live, yes," Dakota answered.
"Oh, I was under the assumption he had made an almost full recovery?" the lady questioned, seemingly a tad confused.
"The experience has taken a toll. Medicines and remedies to alleviate this have been sent to the keep though. We are hoping they will counteract most of the negative effects."
"Linkosta, I want you to write down all of his symptoms later. That is valuable information. Anyways, the tea is fresh, help yourselves. May I see the earring?"
Dakota took off the precious little earring, handing it over to the lady who sat down with it at her working desk, seemingly setting about inspecting it. Linkosta served them tea as a slightly awkward silence formed, Linkosta clearly very interested in what the lady was doing.
"Did you hear we are getting a few new people at the keep?" Sapphire opened, looking to break the silence.
"Really? No, I didn't, sounds like you could use a hand though," Linkosta replied, snapping her head back to look at them.
"Oh yeah, things are crazy at the moment. We could use you too," Balethon interjected.
"Of course you can, I'm very useful," Linkosta replied jokingly.
"Careful now, you don't want to beat Jacky's ego," Dakota added with a chuckle before looking back to the lady.
"Oh please, the mighty Jackalope Furlong, with all the finesse of her mother's favorite hammer."
"Don't let either of them hear that," Sapphire jested in return. She could only imagine the results, though Linkosta would likely pull some trick out of her sleeve to distract long enough to get ready for a fight.
"Yes, I know what these are," Lady Ishani interrupted, seemingly quite pleased with herself. "They were made by Theron a few years back. Interesting they ended up in such unsavory company that quickly. They don't seem to have been altered though, so they should be perfectly safe to use."
"Well, that's a relief," Balethon let out. Sapphire didn't much care. Of course, they were safe, they had used them many times, and Apuma had said so.
"With your permission?" the Lady questioned, looking to Dakota.
"By all means."

"A… S… U...Uhm... R… I can't tell," Tom admitted as Lady Deriva moved the blackboard tablet further away.
"Fuck, you really are blind," Jacky let out. "That's an H. You can read, right?"
"Yes, Jacky, I can read. It's just a little blurry, okay? And my hands won't stop shaking; it's really fucking annoying."
"We are hoping the things Tiguan is carrying will help, otherwise it's gonna be hell to get you back in shape," Nunuk replied, with all the empathy of a military nurse.
"But you can do it right, even if the meds don't work?" Jacky questioned anxiously. Tom had never seen her so sad in victory as after she wiped the floor with him earlier in just about every exercise they could think of. It was probably the ease with which she had done so rather than actually beating him that was the cause though.
"I can, but it will take forever. The damage is everywhere. That is what such remedies are for. In a sense, you were quite lucky that we were able to sneak it in under Esmeralda's care. These kinds of things are expensive," Nunuk replied before going silent and looking at the floor, closing her eyes for a bit. "Right, Tom, time for your little meeting. Do try to be nice, and remember she can hear your thoughts but she can't go looking, so to speak," Nunuk continued, as she started taking off the earring.
"Okay, then do I just put them on or what exactly?"
"Yes, you… hang on. Oh, gods dammit. Why haven't you!? Oh, you have got to be joking," Nunuk let out, clearly frustrated. "You don't have an ear punch do you?" she questioned, looking towards Lady Deriva.
"I think so… oh. Right. Luke, would you mind fetching it? I think it's down in the crafts-hall, with the leatherworking tools." Luke dutifully obeyed his mother, scampering down the stairs.
"Uhm what?" Tom questioned. He didn't like the sound of that, not one bit in fact.
"You need holes in your ears… You can put holes in your ears, right?" Nunuk questioned, seemingly growing a tad doubtful. Tom honestly considered lying and claiming it couldn't be done.
"Can't I just you know hold them or something. Maybe put them in my ear for the time being?"
"I… I don't know actually," Nunuk admitted. "One second." She closed her eyes for a few moments before looking back at him. "Apparently not. Is it a problem for you to have a hole in your ear?"
"Not really…" Tom admitted. He wasn't much for the idea. Then again, he actually really wanted to try out that earring, not to mention the person who would be on the other end was apparently rather important and worked with magic. "Fine, I'll do it... Does it hurt?"
As it turned out, yes, it did hurt. Quite a bit in fact. Tom was fairly sure this wasn't the right tool for the job, at least not for a human, but the punch did its job, and Nunuk stopped the bleeding. None of that stopped Jacky from giving him a bit of shit for being a pussy. Fengi even joined in much to his displeasure.
"Uhm right, so how do I... you know... speak?" Tom questioned after having the earring put in.
"Just sit back, relax, and close your eyes. Otherwise, they will be left open which is… unpleasant afterward. Then you push the slider on the side of the earring down. To get back out push it back up. You will lose your senses so just be wary of that but you can still move."
"Okay," Tom replied slightly nervously as he leaned back into Jacky, lacking a better backrest sitting on a bench as he was. The little metal slide was pushed and the world went dark.
He could neither smell nor hear anything, and even the light coming through his eyelids was gone. He could still move though, just like Nunuk said, so that was something.
'Uhm… Hello?' he tried.
'Yes, hello. I take it you got it to work?' an unfamiliar voice replied. It sounded a tad strange, kinda like it was distorted a bit or something. It was definitely a woman though.
'Arh yes… Uhm this is kinda weird.'
'Oh then you should try some of the more exotic variants; tasting a memory can be quite the experience. Anyway, we two have quite a few things to discuss.' Tom had to ponder that reply for a second as to whether that was something he wanted to try someday.
'Oh yes, is this like one question each then repeat kind of deal?' he questioned, getting back to the matter at hand.
'If you want it to be then sure. I take it you have questions too then.'
'Awesome! Yeah, I've got plenty. I ended up with a unicorn horn. What can that do?'
'That is a very powerful artifact indeed, you are sure that it's... you know, yours?'
'I think technically it's Zarko's. She doesn't strike me as particularly interested though. Right now it's being guarded by Jarix.'
'Well, if I tell you then you are gonna have to answer my questions truthfully.'
'Sure, as long as you don't go blabbing about everything to people who shouldn't know.'
'I can keep secrets. I have quite a few in fact. First question then. Where are you actually from?'
'The Kingdom of Denmark'
'Right… which is where?'
'In the northern part of Europe.'
'I think we might be missing each other a little bit. I know what the reports state about your origin. Where are you from?' The lady reiterated, growing a touch firmer in her tone.
'This very much so constitutes 'do not tell' information.'
'I figured as much since you haven't been telling the truth. I will only be relaying whether your origin is of concern to us.'
'Right… screw it, I'm guessing you could just force it out of me in time if i don't tell?' Tom had heard the retelling of just how they had cracked one of the two mercenaries. That didn't sound like a fate he wanted to share.
'It might be arranged.'
'Okay then.' Tom gave the full rundown on how he had ended up here and what his thoughts were on the subject of going back and forth. Mainly that there was no way he knew of to do it.
The lady had not actually posed any questions that led to major problems. Tom had simply answered as truthfully as possible, making sure to avoid leading her on to just how different their worlds were. All in all, questions like, 'Do you have a king or queen' or 'How many people are there in your world' were not a problem. Even if she apparently thought nearly six million was a decent amount of people, despite Tom giving it as the population of his homeworld rather than just Denmark. The concept of countries apparently did not really translate well. As long as he didn't mention other countries it should work just fine though.
On the subject of his mysterious benefactor that had sent him here she drew a blank too. She didn't know how anyone could open portals to another world like that. Apparently, the magic existed and, with sufficient preparation, she could even perform it herself. That was only between pre-prepared points in this world though, of which there were precious few. Not to mention the cost of conducting such a spell.
'Now I've been very forthcoming so tell me, what does this magic ivory stick do?'
There was a bit of a reluctant pause before she replied. 'A unicorn's horn is the source of both its telekinetic, telepathic, and teleportation abilities. It can be used in many applications such as my teleportation spell. I am in possession of a horn that was gifted to the academy many generations ago for that very purpose. It can also serve as a booster for natural abilities in that field.' A small amount of powdered horn can also be used in enchanting to greatly increase an enchantment's potency. It is also rumored that it holds the power to lift the curse of the dark. Though I know of no one who has attempted to prove it, successful or not.'
'That's quite something… I'm gonna hazard a guess that the reason you didn't want to tell me is because you want it?'
'Don't be daft of course I do. But if it was given to this second lieutenant Zarko then it is hers by law. To defy the will of a unicorn is heresy. As long as no laws were broken by the unicorn I do believe the sentence is death for that one.'
'Well, we kinda just asked 'Hey we found this may we keep it?' To which she said yes. In fact, it was a condition that she would never see it again.'
'In that case, I would claim it's a trophy of the battle, though both the Royal Guard and two keeps could technically lay claim to it at that point… I propose a deal. I will support your claim to the horn in exchange for the opportunity to have it studied. I want to know if it is in any way different to the one in my possession. How does that sound?'
'Hey, I'm not really that worried about who ends up with it, but if it helps the keep then I want it to stay here and so does Nunuk, so I'm gonna trust that. We have been through enough, and this sounds more than a little useful.'
'It could also draw more enemies to your doorstep. I would advise caution.'
Tom had to give her that. Was it worth it? If it could enhance magical abilities then by how much? Maybe Apuma could use it for some crazy shit. Hell, a shield is sort of telekinetic... 'That doesn't sound like something I can decide. I will trust Nunuk.'
'Deriva Keep is not in a position to lay claim to it, if the reports of the battle are anything to go by… You are certain this Zarko does not want to lay claim to it?'
'She didn't even want to touch… I don't think she has yet actually.'
'Well if it does end up staying at Bizmati Keep then I would request the opportunity to have it examined in detail there. Luckily I have a young assistant who specializes in ritual magic just like her father. With a tendency to note everything down. You may tell Nunuk her daughter is coming home for a few months.'
'Uhm… okay. I don't think that would be a problem… could you perhaps, you know, try to make it sound like the horn isn't here. That might help actually.'
'There we go, I was told you could be a deceitful little guy, I reckon that would be wise. I don't want you overrun and the horn stolen… I will discuss this further with the Royal Guard. I believe they have a sizable contingent heading your way.'
'Sounds great, not to be a party killer but I'm not feeling so hot… another time maybe?'
'Well I guess it's your first time using these. I got most of what I wanted anyway. I will…'
Tom didn't listen for the full reply. He felt sick again as he clicked off the earring, the world shooting back into existence and his eyes shooting open.
"That was a little quick?" Fengi questioned, looking concernedly at Tom.
"Yeah, I feel sick."
"Oh come on, I told them you would last longer than her for sure," Jackalope protested.
"Yeah, not my best day thus far. Ugh!" Tom shivered a bit as the nausea thankfully began to slowly subside. He had just expected to feel tired like Nunuk or the others when they used the earrings. Then again he was hardly in top condition at the moment so that might have something to do with it. He had wanted to ask more questions, but right now though he just felt like he should be in bed.
***
The Lady had come out of her trance, sitting there quietly thoughtful for a second or two before looking up.
"Linkosta, time for your first field assignment. They have a unicorn's horn in their possession which I doubt they are willing to relinquish. If what you have told of your mother is correct she will want to keep it and I fear she might have the final word in it. You are to study this horn in detail. I want notes on every crack and imperfection."
"But field assignments are next semester?" Linkosta questioned cautiously.
"I am well aware, consider it a favor. Dakota, I trust this won't be a problem for you or your mother?"
"I couldn't imagine so. It would be lovely to have Linkosta back, even if only for a bit."
"Excellent, you will be paid the small fee for accepting a student for field work, that's the least I can do for this opportunity. When are you planning on departing for home?"
"Depends on the length of the trial. It's due to start in a few days now."
"Oh yes, I remember. Terrible business… I am correct in assuming the combat wing being despatched to your keep is hampered by the same limitation?
"Yes. Colonel Victoria Hashaw is leading them."
"Very well, expect a little nudge in the right direction then, I want this horn under guard as soon as possible. Linkosta, you are coming with me. You need to study the horn in our possession."
"Yes of course," Linkosta replied, seemingly still struggling a bit with what just happened. She certainly didn't seem disappointed that she didn't get to talk with Tom, so Sapphire guessed she just needed a bit of time.
The whole 'nudge in the right direction' sounded just fine to Sapphire. She wouldn't have minded departing right away, but they needed to get the bitch first. That was why they had come here after all. The lady had departed with Linkosta, letting them know they were free to go, though they were more than welcome to enjoy the tea.
They loitered a bit before finding their own way out. Much to Sapphire's amazement they weren't even assigned guards as they walked the corridors of the legendary building, doing a little sightseeing though being careful not to get themselves lost. They couldn't stay long though since they had other places to be today.
The Flaxens had sent a messenger the day before, saying that they had managed to scrounge together the agreed-upon amount ahead of schedule. They had swung by the traders guild to pick up Vulzan and the majority of his escorts to help transport the goods in question. Archeon had decided to tag along too, just in case. Which at the very least meant they had the firepower to persuade the Flaxens not to do something stupid if necessary. It meant less heavy lifting too, though Sapphire was a tad conflicted on feeling happy she didn't need to lift large amounts of very valuable cargo. It felt a touch selfish.
Outside the Flaxen mansion, Baron was sitting on his haunches looking as stately as possible, glaring at the Flaxen guards stationed outside. They had all disembarked and made their way inside with both Vulzan's escorts and four Flaxen guards.
When they made it to the armory, Victoria and Lady Hashaw were already there and in the process of going over the contents. It was an underground basement-like structure, though it did have a rather tall ceiling. Most of the stuff down here was clearly either for their guards or slightly finer equipment for their family members, the latter often being very lavishly decorated.
The interesting stuff though was stored inside a vault that had already been opened. Several sets of exceedingly fine armor were currently in the process of being removed so they could have a closer look at them.
"How do we know which is the best one?" Sapphire whispered to Dakota as they walked up to the scene flanked by all their guards.
"We ask the two who know," Dakota replied, looking to Lady Hashaw and Victoria who were accompanied by a few of their own guards.
"Ah, good of you to join us," Lady Hashaw broke out as she noticed them approaching. "Dakota, was it?"
"Yes Ma'am," Dakota replied with a polite nod.
"Terribly sorry, I'm bad with names. I believe your mother's armor is a set of full-plate and that lovely winged helmet, with some rather nice impact mitigation, correct?"
"Indeed, though it also protects against extreme temperatures."
"Ah yes, the old lady did like to feel comfy, even in battle. The padding must be wonderful too," Lady Hashaw reminisced, almost like she had known Nunuk's grandmother. "Anyway, Dakota, would you be looking for a set for yourself or perhaps for your brother?"
Looking over the sets,  they did have a set that was clearly for a male, seemingly very heavily protected, at least judging by the thickness of the pauldrons.
"Perhaps… What enchantments does that carry?"
"Only the basics I'm afraid. Almost a shame to waste so much good metal on such a poor job," Lady Hashaw replied, seeming genuinely saddened by it. "That one though, that is a masterpiece," she continued, pointing towards a very sizable suit. "And not one built for display or ceremony either"
"Well, that certainly won't fit Rachuck," Sapphire let out, moving up to look more closely at the set. In fact, she didn't think it would fit any of them.
"Yes, unfortunately, it's rare to find a warrior who will fit it. Kalbida was truly a beast on the battlefield."
"Wait, Kalbida Furlong?" Sapphire had to question.
"Yes indeed. Such a shame what happened to them. Apparently, some of them are still out there. I think one of her daughters made it though… What was her name?"
"Shiva," Dakota replied, "She's our smith. She will be resizing the set we bring home. She and her daughter Jackalope have been at our keep for over two decades by now."
"Is she now?" The lady replied, seeming rather delighted by the news "Well, talk about a match made in heaven… I would have wanted it for my own collection, though if it might actually end up being used that's far better, and by an actual Furlong at that."
"How did it even end up here, shouldn't that have gone to the family?" Sapphire questioned, looking over the armor in more detail. "Hold out daggers… nice."
"The Furlongs accrued a rather substantial debt to defend their home rather than leave it. The armor was auctioned off long before the final battle for the keep even took place," an elderly male Flaxen clarified for them, clearly not pleased with today's agenda.
The other armor sets had been presented to them by the elderly Flaxen man, who was often swiftly cut off by Lady Hashaw to give them the proper story of the armor in question. One of the sets was over 600 years old, having been meticulously maintained for centuries and a very nice set too at that if perhaps more made for ceremony than battle.
In the end, the choice came down to those three. The Furlong armor, which was clearly the most impressive, the rather poor set that would be fit for Rachuck, and the old armor which was definitely the most valuable if they wanted to sell it.
"I think we are good on the money front. We need the armor. I'm the only woman trained to fight in armor, but I have my mother's armor… Jacky is a menace with a good hammer but that would mean only she and her mother can use it… And she has no training fighting like that at all."
"Well, then you better get her some then. She's a Furlong, it's damn near law for them," Lady Hashaw interrupted, sounding almost offended by the knowledge Jacky was trained as a huntress.
"We could also get that set and put Tom in it," Balethon went, pointing to the ancient set.
"He doesn't know word one of fighting in melee apart from a bit of brawling. And look at the legs, it wouldn't work at all. No, Jacky can learn. She loves sparring as it is, and it's just a step up from what she's used to. Rachuck will have to bite me on this, we are taking that one," Dakota declared, pointing at the Furlong armor.
Sapphire was a little sad there was no way she would fit that. She had wanted to interject that she could probably fit the old armor without too much trouble. It would likely mess with her archery and airworthiness quite a bit though. Then again, she could only imagine the results of putting Jacky in a suit of enchanted armor. It sounded like it was technically Shiva's armor, at least it should have been, had things gone differently.
"What about weapons?" Dakota question, turning to the elderly Flaxen. With an annoyed grunt, the old man had reluctantly started bringing out boxes, staring daggers at them all the while.
They had quite the assortment of different weapons, mostly blades though, which would be a problem for Jacky. She was really best with a hammer or mace of some kind.
They had a talon blade nearly identical to Nunuk's sword in addition to a very nice rapier that was apparently capable of piercing just about anything. In the end, they went for a very nice arming sword which looked about the right size for Rachuck. That way he at least wouldn't be entirely forgotten, not to mention he was likely the finest sword fighter at the keep, even rivaling his mother as she was past her prime by now. The blade was supposed to have some very intricate inertia-based magic, much like what was found in all but a few sets of enchanted armor.
A quick test confirmed that the blade was indeed way heavier than it felt. It was honestly a surreal experience as Dakota delicately knocked it against Sapphire's bracers. It was light and nimble almost to the point where it felt like a toy, but it could brush a parry aside with sheer force if the enemy wasn't ready for it.
"And when do I get something like this?" Sapphire questioned jokingly as they put the blade back in its sheath, content that they had made the right decision.
"Well, if you are diligent in squirreling away your savings and not spending them on beer and jewelry who knows? Your grandchildren might," Dakota replied with a chuckle. "What about you, Maiko? Do you dream of a blade like this at night too?"
"If Victoria decides I'm to be promoted for once, I might be able to afford one someday," he replied with a chuckle.
"Not with that attitude you won't," Victoria replied, as she and her mother picked out the rapier for their part.
Walking out of the Flaxen mansion carrying more gold than Sapphire had ever seen in her lifetime did make her very happy to hand it off to the big 18-ton dragon with a knack for money. Baron was likewise loaded up with what the Hashaws had gotten. With a few friendly greetings and farewells exchanged with Baron and his crew, they had made for the traders guild to store the loot away somewhere nice and safe.

"Ohh I remember that mountain. We slept in a cave there during a storm," Jackalope went, pointing to the center peak of what looked like a miniature mountain chain. "That was a shitty day."
"I bet it was. Does it have a name?" Tom questioned, looking the mountain over.
"Can't remember," Jackalope replied. "Something beginning with 'hyrta' I think."
"That should mark around halfway," Zarko went, looking at her map book.
"Excellent, I can't wait," Jarix replied, clearly excited.
"You do know there is a very high chance we find absolutely nothing right?" Zarko went, in an indifferent tone.
"Oh they'll be there, I know it."
"If they are, people likely have died. I would prefer if we aren't hoping for that," Tom stated. 'Honestly Jarix,' Tom thought to himself. It would seem there was still a ways to go with the young dragon's compassion. He had another lesson to conduct though. "Right, Jacky I want to see you go through this thing again."
"Sure, " Jackalope replied, drawing the revolver from the borrowed thigh holster. Tom had been wondering if it would fit. It had only just done so, but it was on there nice and tight. "Safety is on, weapon is loaded. Reloading; open cylinder and extract," she went through the motions just like he had taught her, extracting the bullets and placing them into the little pouch she had found for storing them until a proper belt could be arranged. Then she proceeded to reload the cylinder before clicking it shut nice and gently.
"Very good. Bring it up to fire."
She responded, bringing the pistol up with both hands and peering down the sights. Tom was not much of an instructor, but he knew the basics. Jackalope's form was on point, though, following their first attempts. He had been worried she would be afraid of the gun following what it had done to her hand the last time. If she was, he certainly couldn't tell. "Looks good."
"I always look good," Jackalope responded in a cocky tone, holstering the revolver again.
"Just a little banged up at times," Zarko responded, mockingly.
"Scars are badass," Jarix added in. "You're just jealous you don't have any good ones."
"Look who's talking, pretty boy," Zarko fired back. She was right of course, Jarix was damn near pristine, even if a bit of the sheen had worn off. Likely the result of not getting the polish he had been talking about.
"Ohh, are we showing scars?!" Jackalope exclaimed. "Well, you gave me one on my nose," she went, stamping her foot a bit. "Got this one when I hit a tree when I was 8... ohh, and Fengi shot me in the ass once by accident. I ain't showing that one though." Tom had to suppress a giggle at that. "That one was a varghulf stinger" She continued pointing to a neat scar across her belly. "What's you got Zarko?"
"Mine are mostly sparring and training," Zarko admitted. "Some idiot tried to beat me up with a glass bottle in a bar once, got me across the shoulder." There was indeed a sizable scar running down her left shoulder, Tom observed. He had thought it was a sword-cut or something. He could see a broken bottle do that though.
"What about you?" Jackalope questioned, looking at Tom. "Ohh quite a few... I was shot a few times, you know when. Got this one cliff diving on vacation once." He went lifting up his trouser leg.
"What's a vacation?" Zarko questioned. "And why did you jump off a cliff?"
"I gotta say even I think that sounds stupid when you can't fly," Jackalope added very thoughtfully.
"Oh right, a holiday is like, some time off from work. Where you can just go and enjoy things. I went traveling for that one. Went someplace warm to relax and have fun."
"You jumped off a cliff... for fun?" Unkai questioned, clearly not buying it.
"Into water of course. There just wasn't quite enough water. A bit like when Fengi dropped me in the lake."
"Ouch," Jackalope went with a grimace.
"Okaaay, Zarko do you get vacations?" Unkai asked, looking away from Tom the mad man.
"We get time off, sure. You know, if we're just sitting around anyway. How long is a vacation?"
"A few weeks usually, we're paid too."
"Then no, we do not," She responded sounding slightly miffed, ears dropping.
"I would like to travel sometime. You know, go see the world," Jackalope responded with a hint of dreaminess to her voice.
"Should have joined the guard then," Jarix added. "If they'd have you."
"Not everyone can just get in because they are a damn dragon." Zarko scolded him.
"Just because Sapphire wasn't good enough doesn't mean I'm not," Jackalope stated confidently.
"Sorry, they care about money mostly. Unless there is a war on. Who knows, depending on what we find today your chances might be improving."
"Hah, when we're done with them, they are gonna ask me" Jackalope replied patting the revolver. Tom really wanted to repeat his earlier statement about not hoping for people being in trouble, but elected to shut up.
There had been a few sights to see, the odd cliff, a forest lake here and there, and a few clearings of course. Mostly though it was the sheer scale of the forest that blew Tom away. It just kept going as far as the eye could see for hours.
"Why aren't there more dragonettes here?" Tom questioned gesturing to the horizon. "There's plenty of food down there, surely."
"Well there isn't much reason to come out here. It's too far from the big cities to be profitable. Not to mention dangerous," Zarko replied, matter of factly.
"We've mostly been left alone," Jackalope countered, scanning the horizon.
"Mostly yeah, when something like this happens you're on your own though. People just prefer to live either in the cities or close to them where we frequently patrol."
"I see... Doesn't it get, you know... overpopulated?" Tom questioned.
"Sure then we start sending more people further out. Some make it, some don't. Most of the success stories come from ones who go and take an abandoned keep. Surviving winter without one is no easy feat, not to mention the things that would rather have you stop breathing."
"Or turn us black as coal," Jackalope added, clearly causing Zarko and Unkai significant discomfort.
"Sounds like a really shitty way to die," Tom replied. Honestly, they just send people out here and cross their fingers? Humans had done the same of course, so he could hardly blame them. It would appear this place fought back a little more than the wild west had though. "Why not just make more keeps then if that works so well?"
"We do build new keeps every now and again, but that is expensive. Most people who can afford it don't really want to spend the money on something as unprofitable as a frontier keep," Zarko replied.
"Or you could just beat the shit out of the previous owners like Nunuk's grandma," Jackalope added. scoring a curious look from both Tom and Zarko, Unkai looking down a bit. "Relax, they were evil… I think. Or just really annoying, I'm not sure."
"Apuma said she was awarded the keep for her service?" Tom went, he was fairly sure that's how it had been presented at least.
"Oh yeah, it was. That didn't mean it was empty though." 'Oof' Tom thought to himself. Then again, might have been a Flaxen bitch or something like that. He wouldn't mind just taking where she lived.

Sapphire was feeling a fair amount of deja vu as she stood looking at the finely dressed individual outside their door. She was in quite a bit better shape today though. She gave herself a mental pat on the back for being a bit more restrained last night.
"I'm here on behalf of the Flaxen estate to formally request that you retract your baseless accusations against Lady Flaxen." Sapphire damn near stabbed the woman in front of her and asked her how baseless she felt a knife to the gut was.
"I think you want Dakota Bizmati for that question. You know, the noble daughter whose childhood friend your Lady stabbed with a poisoned blade." Sapphire replied, with as much malice in her voice as she could muster.
"While I admit circumstances are most regrettable, I must insist that you retract these accusations, as well as refrain from making mention of them." She was at least sounding calm and cordial rather than screaming all the time which was a definite improvement. 'Here we go again,' Sapphire sighed to herself, stepping back.
"All yours, Dakota."
"Your incestuous bitch of a Lady is neither esteemed nor innocent. I will not retract my accusation, and even if I did, I think you have more to worry about."
"Such as?" the person asked.
"The fact that she has managed to insult the royal guard as a whole, Colonel Hashaw and Baron in particular. Oh, and what more was it…  Lying to a royal court, attempting to falsify evidence, and making false accusations of treason in spite of knowing the truth." Dakota stepped forward right into the face of the woman, looking like she was ready to snap at her throat.
"This is just in addition to attempting a murder. In my fucking keep! Of my friend! She is still sick in bed after a week! Had she managed to get away with all that, she might damn well have had us all executed as traitors too! So I reiterate for the slow-minded amongst us, I will not let that bitch go!" Dakota had damn near run out of breath near the end there, but Sapphire couldn't help but crack a smile at the finely dressed woman, who was clearly rather terrified by now.
"Uhh, I am terribly sorry. I truly am, may I come inside so we…"
"No, you may not!"
"Right, of course, see uhm. See I'm here to… negotiate the terms for having the charges dropped."
"We will not negotiate." Dakota responded coldly.
"I must beg you to reconsider, the family has agreed that these charges must not be brought against us."
"Then kick the bitch out," Sapphire added, standing behind Dakota, arms crossed doing her best to look scary.
"But, she is the Lady of the household we could not…"
"Not my fucking problem. Now piss off," Dakota went, pointing down the stairs.
"Would you not at least hear our offer?"
"What's going on?" A still sleepy-looking Balethon questioned, stepping out of his room.
"Just someone who thinks they can buy our honor," Dakota replied in a seething tone.
"No, I merely meant we might come to a… mutual understanding."
"Oh please. We're not that stupid," Sapphire added.
"Well, what's the offer?" Balethon asked. 'Really,' Sapphire thought to herself disapprovingly.
"Why, no less than 500 gold to be paid in various goods." She sounded very impressed with herself at that.
"Pfft that's it?" Sapphire let out. Sure, that was a shit ton of money. About as much as the keep made a year after all. Still, Tom likely had several times that amount just lying around. Not to mention the countless things that were likely priceless in their own right.
"That is a very large sum of money, Huntress," The woman stated, sounding slightly offended.
"Leave!" Dakota sneered at her, still pointing at the stairs and placing her other hand on her sword hilt. 'Maybe I should have brought a sword too,' Sapphire wondered to herself. That was certainly an effective threat after all.
The woman did as instructed, turning away in a huff, trying to seem insulted despite clearly being scared shitless.
"Come on, let's get some breakfast," Dakota went, taking a deep breath easing up a bit.
After eating they elected to spend the day going around the city. Dakota had some errands to run, and they needed to get that appointment at the academy. Once things kick off with the trial they might not have the time after all.
"It's gonna be crazy in there, don't you think?" Sapphire questioned as they were getting ready to head out. "At the Academy I mean."
"Hopefully Tom knows what he's doing. I don't think we will be the ones answering most of the questions after all," Dakota replied, studying herself in the mirror.
"What about those Flaxen people, think they will try something?"
"Oh, I'm sure of it. Just not sure what... What would you do if Nunuk was about to bring shame to us all, by being sentenced to something like this?"
"I… I have no idea... Break her out of jail perhaps?"
"No. It's their reputation they're worried about, that makes it worse."
"They aren't gonna try and kill us, right?" Sapphire questioned, suddenly slightly worried.
"Unless they wanna try to assassinate Hashaw as well it wouldn't do them much good. She's the one pressing the charges, technically. So I think we're quite safe on that front. I'm more worried about Tom."
"Wait, you think they wanna kill Tom?!"
"No. I think someone might wanna know more about him. So please, do try to restrain yourself when bragging and we don't travel alone here. We can't lie to the council, but down here there is no telling who you're talking to." Sapphire's mind flashed back to telling about Tom's little swim with Dakota last night.
"No, I agree we should be careful."
***
"We should be coming up on Hylsdal soon," Zarko went, peering out ahead.
"I think that's smoke," Jarix stated. Tom sure as fuck couldn't see it though.
"Yup, that's smoke alright," Zarko confirmed.
'Oh come on.' Tom thought to himself.
"Well someone's home then," Jackalope added in, not sounding worried.
"Yeah Looks like chimney smoke. Let's go low. Skim the trees, Jarix."
"Skimming the trees," Jarix responded, descending down to as low as he dared. They would maintain this altitude for a while until they were close, then drop down under the canopy for the last leg. There had been no sign of fliers around as they made their approach, finally diving down into the trees at a small clearing.
"Time for an obstacle course then," Jarix went as he began to weave between the huge trees, not slowing overly much in the process. There was a lot of space between them so it wasn't too bad. Still, it was clearly more work than cruising. Tom almost started to feel a little sick from the constant banking. First one way, then the other, over and over again.
"Please… help me," Tom shot up at that.
"What the hell!?" he went. Looking around, the others had clearly heard it too. Shit, that was that mental speech again.
"Da fuck?! Uhm... Hello?" Jackalope tried, also looking around frantically along with the others. There was nothing to be seen though.
"On your left... please."
"Left turn," Jarix warned, banking into the turn.
"By the water," The voice spoke again.
It didn't take long before they broke a treeline, entering a clearing with a small water hole in the middle. Tom's mind was screaming ambush at him as they entered the clearing at speed. He crouched down, unlatching his revolver just in case.
"Down there," Jarix cried out, sounding troubled. As he went into a dive Tom scrambled to hold on.
"Oh shit!" Zarko let out in alarm.
"Where?" Tom demanded, drawing the revolver. Jarix came down hard, trotting over towards something; Tom managed to get to his feet, gun raised, to see for himself. By the side of the water, a familiar-looking white horse was lying down. Head near the water, horn missing and covered in what looked more like mercury than blood. "Oh that can't be good."
"No no no no..." Unkai trailed off as he jumped down, sprinting over to the stricken unicorn.
"No, it's not," Zarko confirmed, sliding down herself.
"Jarix, keep an eye out, would you? This might be a trap," Tom went as he himself jumped down. Jarix responded with a nod craning his neck to look around.
"Is it dead?" Jackalope questioned, as Unkai was frantically looking the unicorn over. Tom took a lap of the creature. He didn't know shit about unicorns, but this one sure looked familiar, even beaten to shit as it was.
"Not… quite yet." It sounded calm if strained until it laid eyes on Tom, who was currently wearing his helmet, goggles, and faceplate. "What the! No not like this!" it pleaded, trying to get up. Tom instinctively raised his hands, taking a step back. It sounded female and it certainly looked like Kalestine to Tom.
"It's cool. I'm the one who made a lot of noise. Noo, problems I won't hurt you." It did calm down again, looking at him with those emotionless eyes.
"You look like a demon," she let out in a weak voice. That sounded like Kalestine alright, here to rescue her and she's got the insults ready.
"Right, ohhh my gods. Bleeding, bleeding first" Unkai went talking to himself clearly awestruck by the situation. He got to work frantically sealing up cuts. There were a fair few arrow-shafts embedded in her as well.
"What should I do?" Jackalope and Tom asked in unison, looking at each other for a second then turning back to the situation in front of them.
"Water. Please water," Kalestine pleaded, Tom obliged, unscrewing his bottle, kneeling down, and letting her drink.
"Jackalope, help wash the wounds," Zarko ordered, sitting down to help Unkai. She applied pressure to the wounds while Unkai worked.
"So uhm… can you die? I mean, aren't you capable of saving people," Tom tried, slightly awkwardly.
It took a bit before she answered. "Yes" she replied, looking at him while she drank. 'I'm not gonna say this can you hear me?' Kalestine nodded slowly in response. 'people might be very hurt where we are going, is it true your blood can save lives'
"Only fresh" She responded. He looked at the others, how didn't seem to react so he guessed this was private. 'If we find any will you help them'
She finished drinking. 'Don't know' it was clear she was struggling to do whatever she had to do to speak. Tom really hoped she meant she didn't know if she could, rather than whether she would.
"How did this happen?" Zarko questioned, not being blessed with a reply. Which clearly annoyed her.
"Do you know if the keep is okay?" Jackalope tried.
"No," Came the strained answer.
"I think she needs to rest," Unkai went, giving a strained sigh as he moved on. "This will hurt. I am truly sorry. Zarko cut it out."
"Taking a knife to a unicorn, there's something you don't do every day. I am truly sorry for this," Zarko went, sounding like she didn't quite believe what was going on. She started to delicately cut out an arrow, going slowly and carefully. Kalestine didn't take it very well, thrashing about on the ground.
"Stop! It hurts!" she went in a demanding tone. Tom had been expecting a headache, though nothing came. In fact, even in his head, she sounded weak and tame.
"We need to get them out," Zarko protested. Unkai nearly froze, looking at the unicorn in horror. "Jackalope, help hold her down, would you? And do your job, guardsman!" Unkai snapped back into reality and the two of them continued to work on the arrows, Jackalope holding down the unicorn's head.
"This feels heretical," Jackalope protested as Kalestine fought against her. It was clear the unicorn was a spent force though, failing to put up much resistance.
"Now, now. It will be over soon," Tom tried in his best nanny voice, hoping he wasn't just insulting her.
"The more you struggle, the more it hurts and the more you bleed," Zarko observed as she and Unkai continued to work.
Kalestine was clearly in great pain, letting out some very distressed neighing that almost sounded more like screaming.
"That's one out. You're doing great," Unkai tried, in an encouraging tone. It was clear he was struggling himself though. Tom guessed that working on what was sort of like a demigod, at least to him, was a rather stressful situation. Kalestine continued to thrash around for the more painful parts, but she did stop protesting the procedure.
It took a while to get the arrows out, but they managed it. After that, it was mostly cuts and bruises and a rather nasty stab wound. She did eventually ease up a bit, breathing growing more steady as the most painful parts of the procedure were over.
"Thank you," She finally went in a meek voice. Jackalope got off her and stood back up.
"See, there you go, good as new"
"Why didn't you just come get us?" Tom questioned. Kalestine responded with a distressed whinney. Zarko lent over to him, and speaking in a hushed tone said,
"Her horn, Tom."
'Well shit,' Tom thought to himself, looking at the broken stump. 'How does something like that even happen?'

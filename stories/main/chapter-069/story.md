Tom entered the infirmary to find the stricken Esmeralda, Kokashi still by her side. She was looking a lot better it seemed. Kokashi's perpetually worried expression was also gone.
"So, how are you doing?"
"I'll manage, thanks for letting me borrow the music box" She tapped the little speaker standing on her bedside table. She seemed a bit more lively too, the first few days even speaking had been hard on her. In fact, she seemed mostly back to her normal self if a little tired looking. Tom guessed she was only still in bed because Nunuk demanded it. He wasn't gonna question her on weird magic dragon poison though.
"Sorry for not coming by, kinda busy yesterday and no problem, that was the least I could do."
"Heard you got the fields plowed, how did the sowing go?"
"I gotta say making furrows with dragon claws is a lot easier than with a hoe." Esmeralda did chuckle at that even if it was a little weakly. Tom was a bit ashamed at that though, he really should have come by more often.
"Thought of something though, sorry I didn't remember sooner, did Kokashi tell you about the movies?"
"Oh yes not just him, Rakshaza and Vigon haven't shut up about Dug and Kevin yet" She did sound like she was in good spirits, that was always good.
"You need to be careful with this. I did bring three, but this is the most precious thing I own." Tom brought up one of the spare laptops he had with him. He knew these things weren't gonna last forever, but losing one would still be a big hit. Esmeralda sat up in her bed leaning against the wall, as she looked at the strange box on her lap.
"Tom you shouldn't wha… I don't know what to say"
"Hey you're borrowing it" Tom went in jest, of course, she knew that, "Just be careful with it. They are quite fragile and don't get liquid anywhere near it."
Kokashi leaned in looking at it, tapping the keyboard a few times. "So that is what you doing late at night. I was wondering what that sound was." Nice reminder that things weren't as private around here, Tom thought to himself.
"Yes, this is a computer, more specifically a laptop because it sits on your lap... see." He went, gesturing at the machine.
"Sure… is this my lap?" Esmeralda questioned placing her hands on her thighs.
"Right sorry I forgot. yes, that is your lap… Anyway. At its most basic this is a thinking machine. It can remember a lot of things, like books or movies. I don't have any books in Draconic or movies for that matter. I thought you could watch the movies we saw and then Kokashi can explain for you"
"Sure, I wanna watch those Red Tails again too," Kokashi replied optimistically. "You say it can remember. How much can it remember?" Boy how to answer that one?
"Well, in book form that box on your lap can remember more information than every book in the world I think." There was a look of apprehension and a tinge of fear on her face.
"And you have kid's movies on it?"
"...yes, and drawings of things we need, pictures from my home and a lot of music. Just be careful with it and enjoy the movies okay?"
"I'm just gonna pretend I understand what you are talking about," Esmeralda went, confusion near total as she looked at it. "Thank you for lending me something so precious, but… how does it... you know… work?"
"Right, first off…" Kokashi leaned in to get a better look as well, as he went about explaining how to use the marvel of engineering that was the computer.
Perhaps it wasn't entirely fair on the two dragonettes but Tom felt like he was explaining the internet to a couple of grandparents. This was likely the most advanced piece of technology ever held by a dragonette though so they did have an excellent excuse.
Still, figuring out how to double click on an icon shouldn't have been that difficult. By now they could open a movie though, so that would have to do.
"Remember it's no kids toy either and whatever you do, don't let Jackalope have it"
"Certainly not. Thank you." Esmeralda replied, seeming very excited.
"Don't mention it, oh and the battery will last around 4 hours then it needs to be recharged like the spea… music box." Tom had put the two movies Kokashi had seen on the desktop for them.
"No worries. Now hubby, what do you wanna see first?"
"Definitely Red Tails" The guard responded a little sternly. Thinking back Up might have been a very poor choice for a couple dealing with a sick wife… goddammit he was an idiot. He would have to do better for next movie night.

"I keep telling you we should just ask for directions, come on he looks nice" Balethon went pointing at a street vendor selling different kinds of fried meat on sticks.
"Yup," Maiko replied, electing that he was done waiting for them and went over to the stall, leaving them standing. A brief chat and two beef sticks later, one of which one was handed to Balethon, much to Sapphire's annoyance and they knew where they were going.
"We were already heading down here anyway, we would have found it" Dakota protested.
"Yeah, yeah" Maiko clearly wasn't impressed by them right now. They had gotten fairly close but must have missed it. The sun was getting lower in the sky so making out the signs was getting a bit tricky "Isn't that it?" he went, pointing up to a dangling sign on the third level.
"Sure looks like it," Balethon replied with false exasperation. Sapphire didn't care about the teasing though. She was already going up the stairs to the next level, it had been half a decade since she last saw a member of her family, she just crossed her fingers that Haiko would be here.
She turned back to look at the others who were slowly following along "Come on!" Dakota and Balethon did pick up the pace a little, even if Maiko was clearly content with his leisurely pace munching on his beef stick.
As she made it up the stairs to the third level, looked to the door, seeing a single armored man standing guard outside and only sleeping slightly at his post.
"Haiko!" The man gave a start as he looked up and began scanning the crowd. It didn't take long for him to find her as she was already sprinting for him.
"Saph!" He just about got out before she slammed into him. "Oomph. Happy to see you too" He just embraced her or at least tried as she lifted him off the ground. It had been way too long.
"Oh, I knew you would be here. How's it hanging" She put him back down.
"Not too badly, got the job as you can see, it's nice and quiet most of the time. How about you, enjoying the quiet life in the countryside"
"Ha, if only. If anything, things have been too exciting as of late."
"How come that be, all I heard from the patrons was a keep out east was attacked a month ago and nearly wiped out."
"Yeah, that was us. We were the ones doing the wiping out though" Haiko looked at her with a stunned expression for a second.
"But... What!" He finally exclaimed sounding almost angry, for a second before calming down. "But there was a black knight wasn't there?... how many did you lose?"
Sapphire's expression changed to something a bit more pained at that, it hadn't been a clean victory after all.
"They killed a four-year-old. as a hostage"
"I'm so sorry" he went, pulling her into a hug again. "Wait, hostage, they got inside!?"
"Yeah, last mistake they ever made" Sapphire's companions made it up behind her, so she turned to do the introductions.
"Haiko, meet Dakota, my commander, daughter of my Lady, and a very good friend. Balethon, guard of the keep, and Maiko, corporal in the royal guard."
"I remember you, Dakota, you were with Saph last time right?"
"That I was, pleasure to meet again"
"Likewise, and a royal guard, what are you doing here? It's a pleasure of course" Haiko went looking at the corporal.
"Just here to report where they end up staying. If you gotta have a good drink I'll tell you a war story though." He went with a smirk.
"I'm sure someone might, not seen you before either, Haiko, Saph's big brother"
"Oh, we've heard of you alright." Hands were shaken all around as they all stood outside the little tavern. It looked nice enough though.
"I'm sure you have, now come on in. Draki! Mind covering for me, one of my sisters is here!" He shouted inside.
"No way! Sure bro." Came the reply. As they went inside a very small male dragonette with a long pike over his shoulder came walking past giving Haiko a fist bump as they passed. Sapphire just had a chuckle. It was good to be back here again.
The inside was mostly tables and chairs, with a single bar up against the far wall. There was a fireplace on the left wall and stairs leading up to the rooms above. There were a few patrons here and there, it wasn't cramped though, just cozy.
"Hey, Reiker got a room for my sister and her two friends?"
"Sure, we got plenty, how many do they want?" The man behind the bar answered.
"We'll take two" Dakota replied, Sapphire guessed the two of them were sharing them, not a problem.
"No problem, here you go, first two on the left. You want meals too?"
Dakota looked back at Haiko, "Can they cook here?"
"Oh yeah, chef's amazing. If you go up with your things I'll buy the first round"
"Very well, two rooms with meals. For at least a week, probably more."
"Can do" the barkeep replied noting something down on a slate. "That will come to 44 copper per night for the three of you." That wasn't a bad price Sapphire mused to herself, she wondered if they were getting a discount right now.
They went up to their rooms to dump the bags and get changed. They had been carrying those around for hours and they were still all in winter gear.
"Not a bad place it seems, almost worth the walk" Dakota went in jest as they got changed.
"Hey, it's not my fault I hadn't seen it yet. What now though?"
"I say we take the day off, you have a good chat with your brother and we drink Balethon under the table. Then we see what happens tomorrow, we should have plenty of time. You think our things will be safe up here?"
"If they're not I'll break his neck" Sapphire replied jokingly.
"I totally believe you" Dakota replied sarcastically. "Now let's see if we can get a war story out of the corporal, I'm tired of hearing about daring trade runs where nothing happens apart from them getting chased for a bit"
They made it back downstairs to find the three men already sitting at a table, two mugs standing ready for them.
"Right then, everyone's here. So what brings you to these parts with a royal guard escort and for weeks no less"
"Legal matters, executed a traitor, some noble bitch didn't like it, she then stabbed my oldest friend with a poison dagger, so were are here to bury her in shit as deep as we can."
Sapphire could feel a few of the other tables switching their gaze to look at them. That was quite the opening.
"I see, did this have to do with you know" Haiko tried, clearly concerned about broaching the sensitive subject.
"Yeah, the traitor let them in our door. Was even dumb enough to confess"
"Only after he was given a few minutes with Tom" Sapphire added.
"Tom?"
"Oh yeah, you need to meet him one day, he's awesome. Killed a dark knight like it was some annoying cretin" Balethon interjected. Well, they certainly had the attention of everyone now.
"He's a strange one for sure", Maiko added, sipping his drink.
"A dark knight, just like that?" Haiko questioned, clearly not quite believing it.
"Well, my mother and I had been dueling the beast first, not that we were winning" Dakota added in a somber tone, that had been a very close call.
"How did he do it, you don't just…"
"Fire magic" Sapphire cut him off. "He's a powerful mage, speaking of we should totally go see Linkosta, isn't she still studying at the academy."
"She sure is, you aren't the only one who gets to see some long lost family on this trip," Dakota added before taking a deep draught of the beer. This was some quality stuff unlike what they had on their way here.
"Oh come now, you were here last year too." Sapphire objected. Dakota just kept the mug to her mouth looking at Sapphire with a sly smile.
"What about Viper, is she around?" Sapphire questioned, turning to Haiko.
"Don't know to be honest. She is flying with the traders and has been for a while. I don't think she is right now, but if you're here for a while, who knows, she might come by." He replied with a shrug.
"Fingers crossed, you do look better when you smile," Balethon added. Sapphire just shook her head a bit, raising her mug.
"To family reunions"
"To family reunions" They all echoed, even Maiko despite not really knowing anyone involved. Still, the beer was worth a cheer.

With Esmeralda seen to, it was time for the day's hunting expedition. Unlike last time they were hunting the woods. Jackalope's hand was also finally out of its bandage even if it still looked a little rough. She could shoot her bow in a pinch but Tom guessed that would be a rather painful experience. Her wings were perfectly functional though so he currently found himself sitting in a treetop with her, watching the forest floor below rifle at the ready.
"You seen anything yet?" Jackalope went impatiently. Feet dangling over the side.
"No, and I won't if you keep making noise." He could hardly be mad at her, she must be bored out of her mind right now. "Wait, what's that?"
That got her attention as she shot up to look, clambering over nearly causing him to fall off the branch. "What, where?"
"Well, if there had been anything there it would be long gone now. Calm down, or we won't ever get anything."
"Why don't you just jump on my back and we take them at ground level, like a proper huntress."
"'Cause I can't hit anything when you are going flat out like that and you know it."
"I can, Sapphire definitely can, even Fengi can."
"Well, you aren't lying on top of someone trying to keep a long metal stick steady."
"You think using a bow is easier?" Fair point, it was easier when you were the one doing the wingbeats though.
"No, clue haven't used one since I was a kid," There was a disgruntled sound as she returned to her branch and continued to dangle her feet over the edge. "What about the others have they found anything yet?"
"Maybe, how should I know when we are just sitting here doing nothing"
"Fair point." It took a lot more waiting before anything happened, Jackalope did eventually shut up though. Eventually, there was some actual rustling in the bushes below, as some massive beast came lumbering along.
"Jackalope what's that?" Tom went as quietly as he could.
"Huh, what's what?" Oh, she had fallen asleep, that explained the lack of noise, at least she slept light.
"Careful don't scare it. That big thing down there." Jackalope slowly clambered over at least trying to be stealthy for once. Being white didn't really help her case, but she was trying.
"A Tirox, you know like the little energetic guy in Archeon's crew. Those things are big and slow, supposedly great steaks too. I still think he was named for irony though"
"Or maybe hopefulness. Looks huge, can we kill it?" It looked like a huge ox that, might well be the size of a small rhino. "How would we even get that out."
"Sure, I bet Jarix could lift that if he really wanted to."
"You sure? Looks heavy. You think he would be okay with walking home?" Jackalope just stared at him like he was crazy.
"Tom, that would take until tomorrow you dumb fuck. I'm sure he can fly with it though." Taking Jackalope's word for it probably wasn't the best idea, but damned if he knew what that thing weighed.
"I'm not sure though, shouldn't we ask first?"
"And then it's gone when we get back.  Just kill it, would you?" Well, Jackalope was still technically in command and he wasn't about to disobey an order, like that. The horns on that thing would make an awesome trophy too.
Tom felt like some big game hunter stalking his prey as he hung over the side of the huge branch they were sitting on, taking aim directly on the creature's neck at the base of the skull. The huge cow thing was just grazing merrily far beneath them. Giving him a clear shot straight down, "Here goes nothing then"
The shot rang out and he ran the action ready for a follow-up shot. He had hit his mark though as the beast tensed for a moment then collapsed in a heap on the ground.
"Nice shot dude, it just fucking died on the spot!" Jackalope went excited as always when things went bang. "I always hate it when Sapphire does that, thinking she is better than everyone." Tom chuckled a bit at her enthusiasm, he had sure hit his mark. It wasn't that far down though and not a small target either. Hardly a masterful performance.
"Yeah yeah, go get the others will you, I'll guard it in the meantime."
"You got it," Jackalope responded as she dropped off the branch taking to the wing. As he sat there keeping an eye on the forest around him. It was all rather idyllic, if awfully quiet following the shot. Before he came here he might have been worried by the roughly one hundred meter drop, but now he was just chilling on a branch as wide around as an oil drum.
It took a bit, but eventually Jackalope returned with Fengi and Zarko, he guessed Jarix was overhead with Radexi.
"How are we gonna bring that home, genius?" Zarko protested.
"There's a clearing over there for Jarix, drag it over there and off we go" Tom replied optimistically.
"He ain't gonna like this." Zarko just responded before heading back up. The three of them just looked at each other shrugging for a moment.
"Why not, it's good exercise" Tom jested holding up his hands.
"You mean hard work" Fengi clarified with a smirk "Let's go see what we got."
"Yeah hop on huntress" Jackalope went chuckling giving Tom a playful punch.
"Haha very funny, miss broken hand"
They circled down to the beast landing to inspect it. It was even bigger when down next to it. Tom wondered if Jarix really could carry this thing, jokes aside. It was likely gonna be a tight margin meaning a lot of breaks. At cruising speed they were still around two hours from home.
He saw Jarix set down in the clearing, trotting over.
"Oh, you gotta be kidding me" He went in dismay looking at the tirox.
"Look at it on the bright side. There are some epic steaks in there" Jackalope tried, a noble effort to cheer him up, Tom admitted, as he looked at the dragon.
"Think you are up for it?" Zarko questioned, clearly not certain herself.
"Only one way to find out. Gods, this will be like basic training all over again. Wait, is that your plan here, am I going through basic training again?" Jarix went looking at Tom accusingly.
"It was just the first thing to come by… sorry"
"How did you even kill it, there isn't a mark on it?" Jarix questioned, walking around the tirox looking it over.
"The little red dot on its neck" Tom replied. "That's the bullet hole, broke its neck in a single shot. Didn't want to get our precious dragon dirty"
"Very thoughtful," Jackalope added, trying her best to sound convincing. She was being remarkably helpful today. Or at least trying to be.
"Why thank you for caring. The gun you are making for me is even bigger than yours right?"
"Oh yes," Tom replied proudly. "We're going with fifty caliber for you"
"For the big machine gun then. Get the rope out" They did as instructed, as the dragon laid down next to the tirox and they began preparing lashings. Actually getting the tirox onto Jarix was a problem Tom hadn't really foreseen and it was too big to be dangling beneath him.
In the end, the very much not graceful solution was to have Jarix lay up against it while they lashed the two of them together. Praying the ropes and harness would hold. With a heave of effort, the young dragon rolled over, dragging the tirox onto his back.
"By the king, that is heavy" It took a bit more work to get the load properly settled and secured, but with some delicate maneuvering and creative use of an oak tree it looked more or less good to go. It looked ridiculous but it might just work.
"Right then, wish me luck" Jarix went in a perturbed tone, as he shifted the load a bit. He would have to circle while climbing with a very heavy load to clear the tall heaven oak. Not to mention the act of getting airborne in the first place, with limited space available.
"Time to see what the royal guard are made of" Tom went, trying to encourage the dragon.
Jarix backed up into the forest, for a run-up, before charging into the clearing at a gallop. Folding out his wings as he cleared the trees. With a powerful kick from his hind legs and a beat of those mighty wings and he was airborne. The second beat came only just in time to keep his feet off the ground as he began to lay into the turn clearly straining to hold it. He was gaining speed though so Tom guessed it was going well.
"You go Jarix you got this" Jackalope cheered, Fengi joining in.
Then Radexi spoke up "I just don't get why we didn't cut it into smaller pieces"
They all looked at each other for a second. "That might not have been a bad idea" Zarko finally admitted.
"You're doing great!" Jackalope continued shouting, enthusiasm slightly dampened.
Jarix was steady in the turn now and climbing slowly as he went around and around. "Looks like we're good," Zarko added, still sounding a bit uncertain.
"I say we join him, get your stuff. Fen mind getting Tom airborne, or do you want the first leg?" Jackalope questioned.
"I got him, don't want you to miss out on his company," Fengi replied in a teasing tone. 'What was that supposed to mean?' Tom thought. As he looked to Jackalope she did look a bit uncomfortable before taking off climbing up ready to have Tom loaded on.

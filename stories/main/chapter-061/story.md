At Hashaw's insistence, Baron had come up to watch the scenes as well, since he kinda had to know. Most of them had gone to bed, Sapphire had stuck around though to see the legendary dragon's reaction.
Tom had agreed a Baron hadn't even seemed very concerned about the display of death he was being shown. Sapphire didn't even look at the movie, she just watched Baron. He asked questions about standard combat ranges, for far and how long they could fire. All in all, he was exceedingly calm. Only the Nuke as Tom called it got a reaction from him even if it was slight.
"I concur. This must not be allowed to become our future."
"Very good. Now, I have one more thing"
Tom then proceeded to treat them to a clip of their earliest aerial warfare concerning a very famous fighter ace which apparently shared Baron's name, even if this Red Baron wasn't actually the name of the one in the red plane. That had actually gotten a chuckle from the old legend.
Tom had used that movie to try and convince Hashaw that humans could in fact fight with honor if given the chance. Going as far as to risk their lives to honor a dead opponent. Sapphire had to agree with him. This was about as honorable combat as she had seen, even if they fought a little strangely.
It was fascinating to see the flying machines stumble around the sky. It had been almost laughable in fact, they looked more like kids trying to play catch than anything else. Sapphire had even chuckled a bit at their ineptitude, as had Baron. Hashaw just shook her head.
The smile faded when one of the planes managed to 'catch' another. The result was a torn piece of wreckage falling out of the sky in smoke and flames.
Tom explained it was called a dog fight, the objective was to get your plane pointing at the enemy so you could use machine guns to shoot them down, the same weapons they had used on the beach. Such an extreme mix of insane killing power and terrible flying. It wasn't very different from some of their own aerial battles though, at least in concept.
Tom had explained that just like Sapphire had guessed, this was only a few years after they figured out how to fly. Apparently even taking to the sky in these machines was considered extremely dangerous, as they would often break and just fall out of the sky. Not to mention most of the pilots had either very poor or no training at all. With that in mind, they had done rather well in Sapphire's mind.
It of course threw both Hashaw and Baron for a loop, as they struggled to figure out how everyone they had just seen had less flight experience than most young adult dragonettes. And flew machines built by people who barely knew what they were doing.
When she made it into bed that night, Sapphire said a prayer. It had been a while since she had last done a proper prayer, but it seemed right to pray for those who had given their lives with such bravery. She had no clue if her gods were willing to smile upon those of another world or their descendants, but it was the least she could do.
It had been a terrifying experience, but what an experience it was, She was exhausted yet couldn't sleep. She guessed a few of those images would trouble her for quite some time. Sapphire couldn't wait till he got out something a bit less dark like he had promised. Though she had been starting to enjoy the one about the red baron. It helped that they didn't talk while in the air, which was all Tom had shown them, so that had probably helped.
He claimed that with some work he could make text come up, so they could read what they were saying. Even if he had yet to figure out how to make it write in draconic. Perhaps she would just have to put in some more effort with the English lessons.
The next day the colonel had spent much of the early hours discussing with Tom, the Bizmati family, and Lady Flaxen. Judging by the now-familiar shouting and screaming, the lady wasn't happy with the news. Following that, lady Flaxen decided to start her own investigation. That meant Sapphire and Esmeralda found themselves assigned to keep an eye on her along with two of Hashaw's retinue. As shit duties went this was just about the worst Sapphire could remember receiving.
They made sure to keep a very close eye on her, following her wherever she went. Nunuk had expressed concerns they might have to face underhanded tricks aimed at turning the colonel against them. With Tom occupied, there were an awful lot of questions they just couldn't answer, and with every failure to answer, they suffered a verbal tirade from the woman.
About the only nice thing, she had seen today was when they had passed the greeting hall to find Jarix and Archeon lying side by side and not even arguing. It would seem Tom's shock lesson had gotten through somewhat then.
"And what is this supposed to be?!" the Lady demanded of them, having found yet another thing. At least she hadn't touched this time following swords being drawn on the last occasion.
"A music box"
"How does it work?" Sapphire looked to Esmeralda before they jointly answered.
"We have no idea"
"By the gods you are useless. If you don't know it could be anything, dark magic, the depths of hell how would you know?"
"It plays beautiful music, not battle chants or demonic screeching" Esmeralda answered with a sigh.
"Sergeant, can you sense any evils within this artifact?"
"No ma'am"
"You didn't even try. Don't you think I can see whether you are doing your job or not?!"
"Everything was searched yesterday, including that and frankly I still have a headache after all that." Sergeant Kolinky was clearly exhausted already he just like Sapphire had stayed up late. He had even fallen asleep during the discussions last night and today hadn't given him many breaks either.
"And yet you somehow didn't find anything besides a very large amount of artifacts no one seems to understand except that hideous looking thing. You don't find that a little strange?"
"His name is Tom" Esmeralda clarified in no uncertain terms.
"I don't care huntress."
"You should" Maiko added, Maiko struck Sapphire as the kind of fighter who would throw sand in your eyes then throw a net over you for good measure. That was likely the reason he was still a corporal. Given the chance, she guessed he and Tom would get along famously.
"And why is it that, you lot all seem like he beat the shit out of you last night. With whatever it was that. I! wasn't allowed to witness! If I didn't know better I would think you all a bunch of cowards."
"Because let me make it clear, ma'am. If he wants you dead then you're dead."
"I have an escort of Royal guard veterans and the legendary Baron and a single malformed… thing has gotten you scared! What kind of cut-rate scoundrels are you!?"
"Lady Flaxen, insult me again and I won't even try and stop him, is that clear?" Maiko responded, clearly done with her shit.
"Disobeying orders too I see, perhaps you should just be left here. You might fit in better." The sergeant let out a deep grumbling sigh, putting his hand on Maiko's shoulder.
"Where to next?" The sergeant asked as calmly as could be managed. This was getting real old, real fast for Sapphire.

"Right  then, have you had a chance to sleep on last night's lesson?" Tom went, as he strode out into the greeting hall, Colonel Hashaw and Nunuk on his heels. Finding Archeon and Jarix both there. It was a little tight for the two of them, but not too bad. Now that they were up against each other it was easy to see both similarities and differences. Jarix was considerably smaller, Tom guessed he was less than half the weight though the length was closer.
"I feel I must first apologize for calling you a coward, I..."
"Don't worry about it, as I said you didn't know. Actually, before we continue, the walls might have ears here today so what say you to a quick flight before discussing more?"
"Uhm… okay, may my father join us?"
"Most certainly, in fact, I insist on it" Tom went walking over to get off his weights. If he had learned anything it was that they didn't belong in the sky. He checked all the straps on his parachute, walking back over.
"What are those for?" Jarix questioned curiously.
"Helps keep me strong, they are just lead weights. No need to bring them flying though and this might keep me from going splat if I fall off. You coming Arc?"
"Certainly, Vulzan saddle up." The venerable old trader responded, mood seemingly greatly improved since yesterday. "I must say, Tom, I was starting to have my doubts you could get through to him."
"You weren't alone, but this is a discussion for elsewhere. Permission to climb aboard Jarix?"
"Come on up you little strange thing" Jarix responded in a jovial tone. Low grav certainly helped with the ascent, but still, it was an awkward climb. "A shame I can't use icepicks for this?"
"Why not?" Radexi asked, clearly not understanding what those were.
"They are like climbing spikes, I don't think it would feel nice."
"Ohhh" Radexi responded realizing the implications.
"You aren't hammering spikes into me, that's for sure" Jarix stated.
Tom managed though, swinging up to settle down. Looking back and forth he could see the spikes up here had been filed down and a few handholds could be found attached to the harness, so plenty of handholds. Radexi and Zarko though, sat squatting down like true Gopnik's. Tom elected to just sit down like he was on the ground and hold on for dear life. If it came to a meeting with the dulled spikes he was wearing armor after all.
Luckily Nunuk had allowed him to ditch the ridiculous jewelry and get his proper boots on again. Combined with his helmet and goggles he was looking a lot meaner today. Even if the flag cape kinda ruined the look.
"Colonel I think Baron should join us for this"
"Agreed, See you up there" She replied jogging out to the edge dropping off."
"Mind giving an old lady a lift Arch" Nunuk questioned walking over Dakota and Rachuck flanking her.
"Certainly, up you come. Archeon lowered his wing to let the three of them walk up it. Zarko and Radexi just snickered looking at Tom.
"Goddammit," Tom went looking away. He felt like an apprentice in a machine shop going to fetch the left-hand screwdriver.
"No it was good to know you can climb, you never know when that might be handy" Zarko went in an extremely unconvincing tone.
The sensation of sitting on something as it launched itself into the air was a new one. It felt almost like the world's least safe rollercoaster. Once airborne though it wasn't bad at all, the wingbeats were even slower than with the dragonettes. Even when climbing it was a much more slow and steady affair. He was glad he had the goggles and helmet as well for today since the wind was quickly getting very intense.
"Look at him, he doesn't have a clue does he?" Radexi shouted out.
"No, he doesn't. Careful Jarix we have an inexperienced passenger"
"Hey, I have flown before," Tom protested.
"On dragon back?" Zarko questioned, in the kind of sultry tone used for someone you were pretty sure was lying.
"Mostly dragonettes I admit. Did fight from Archeon's back once. Didn't go that well though."
"Oh right, that was when you fell in the water" Jarix boomed out.
"Yeah not entirely my fault though, I got carried off."
"Man not being able to fly gotta suck!" Radexi replied, clearly not considering just how true that statement was.
"Yup," Tom just replied, trying not to sound sour. They had no clue how fucking lucky they were.
"Also, is this what you look like normally?" Radexi asked, gesturing to Tom.
"Minus the cape yeah mostly."
"Why would you take that off, it looks good?"
"What do you think would happen if one of the guys yesterday had been wearing this?" Tom flapped his cape a bit for dramatic effect.
"Ohhhh" Right then, speaks before he thinks. Well, at least he was likely honest then.
"You should see me in full battle kit, perhaps I will come and scare you in the night, Sure gave Vulzan a scare that night" Tom chuckled a bit to himself at the terrified traders face.
"Jarix, someone is getting too confident back here," Zarko shouted out.
"Roger That" 'Huh' was all Tom managed to think before Jarix folded up his left-wing and they rolled into a dive. Okay, this was very different than having someone to hold onto. Tom had just been holding onto a spike with one hand enjoying the ride. Now he was hanging from that spike, like some kind of Hollywood action movie.
"Jesus Christ! A little warning next time!"
"We don't get that!" Zarko retorted, Radexi just laughing at the spectacle. "You either hang on or you fall off those are the rules."
"You don't die if you fall off!" Tom tried reasoning.
"All the more reason to hang on then" Zarko replied very calmly if still shouting, to beat the wind. Tom guessed she could catch him if she had to. His expectations for Radexi weren't great though. Jarxi finally finished his rolling dive pulling up, laughing as well.
"Sound like you are having fun back there?"
"Two of us are. I think it's time for a lesson of our own." Zarko replied. Tom wasn't sure he liked the sound of that. Calling yourself a trained dragon rider sounded hella awesome, but he had a feeling this was going to get uncomfortable.
"Jarix next to the old man if you could"
"Can do" Jarix began beating hard for altitude again. Climbing up towards where Archeon was now soaring above. Behind them, Baron was taking to the sky as well climbing slowly.
"Lesson one you are always holding on to something even if we don't have to. Two, Jarix decides what happens. We can make suggestions, but he is flying and he is in command, your rank doesn't matter. Three, our problems are up here" She gestured above to the sides and behind. "everything else is Jarix's job."
That seemed easy enough, though hanging on for dear life and shooting was going to be a problem. One-handed with a pistol might be possible though. Damn them and their walking around not worrying. How were they supposed to worry about that though? Looking around Tom saw a pair of crossbows lashed to the armor at the wing shoulders.
"I'm guessing that's for bad guys behind us?"
"Correct, can you use one?"
"You know what I use," Tom replied holding up a revolver.
"Right, of course. We there yet, or did you eat too much this morning?"
"I haven't eaten since the day before yesterday and you know it. I'm starving here." Jarix replied.
"Oh, you'll manage I'm sure."
What a machine gun wouldn't do back here. Tom thought to himself "I saw Baron had a ballista, why haven't you?"
"This young strapping lad should be able to get behind most other dragons, Baron though might need a hand keeping them off his back."
"I see, makes sense" perhaps forward-firing then, or over the side broadside style. Then a turning fight becomes the objective rather than something to avoid.
"You look like you are making plans? Not sure I dare ask what they are after yesterday" Zarko asked
"Slap a good machine gun on him and just blow anyone out of the sky who gets close" Tom retorted.
"You wanna give me one of those death machines!?" Jarix went excitedly.
"I thought you promised the colonel you didn't have one?" Zarko questioned
"You know the deal. If I find you worthy of it. And no I would need to build it first. I haven't even gotten what I need to build, what I need to build it though."
"So you're broke?" Radexi asked
"No not even close, traders just don't come by often."
"Hey Jarix, think we could put in a supply order for some spares?"
"Might wanna take that up with Hashaw and Baron, but maybe" Oh he had military backing now. Tom hadn't even thought of that.
They made it up to level with Archeon as Zarkon got up and took a walk over the wing crossing over, simply walking from wing to wing. "Show off" Tom tried to taunt, being rewarded with a turn and bow from her before she continued to walk backwards.
After a short chat, she came back over and Archaeon fell back. "Right then, the chase is on. Hang on and don't be an idiot!" She shouted, grabbing hold of a handle with her clawed foot.
"Ohhh" Tom let out. That's what those were for.
"Heavy Hostile to our rear. Hard right!" Zarko bellowed out.
"Hard right," Came the response from Jarix as he leaned hard into the turn. This time Tom was ready though, as he held on for dear life the lean did mostly mean he just got heavier rather than fall off. It was a hard turn and both the dragonettes crouched down. Tom just straightened his back with a smile, this was great fun.
"Hostile following turn… not gaining… falling back" Zarko continued, clever system Tom thought to himself she was basically spotting for Jarix then. Enemy six o'clock sounded cooler though.
"Holding turn" Came the response from Jarix.
"Yeah, you got him" Radexi cheered, roaring in approval.
Hey well if this was a flying lesson Tom didn't have a problem with it, this was awesome he thought, as he joined Radexi in cheering.
"The turn doesn't bother you?" Zarko asked.
"Girl, where I'm from, you couldn't even fly, this is fairly normal" He replied with a laugh. this was heavier than back home, they might be pulling 2 G tops though.
"Huh?"
As they continued the turn Archeon finally gave up, pulling up hard doubling over. Tom guessed he wanted to intercept them as they came around the turn.
"Hostile going high and right. Reverse turn!" Zarko bellowed out.
"Reversing turn" Came the reply and they rolled over pulling into another hard turn.
Archeon clearly figured out he was in a world of shit right as they came up behind and below him. He had just sacrificed all his speed for altitude and they were catching fast. As they approached he flaired up to vertical, beating his wings, coming to a dead stop trying to make them overshot. Watching a creature the size of a flying lory with several people on board pull a cobra maneuver at this range was quite the sight.
"Target dead to rights. Hang on" It came from Jarix as he too pulled up hard. Heading straight for his father at what Tom thought was a distinctly unsafe closing speed. As he closed he rolled over onto his back passing beneath Archeon only, meters to spare.
"That's a hit"  He roared out as they passed Archeon who looked like he was standing still in the air. Radexi and Zarko both roared out in triumph. It hadn't been anywhere close to a fair fight and a distinctly swift victory. It was all in good fun though.
They joined back into formation with Archeon as they continued to make way.
"Are you carrying cargo old man?" A very smug Jarix questioned.
"Hey if I had my escorts you wouldn't just get away with holding a turn like that and as a matter of fact I am." Archeon retorted.
"What escorts… the ones Tom shot down?"
"How did he manage to get that sprightly already, I thought you got him grounded for once Tom?" Archeon seeming not upset in the slightest at the outcome.
"Well you haven't got a big ass gun yet so I guess that's why."
"You wouldn't give him that would you?" Jarix question concernedly.
"If it keeps you grounded in reality, then certainly." Tom joked back. "Hey, Arch how much can you carry?"
"Oh I dunno about three tons, maybe four on a good day"
"That's a pretty fucking big gun Jarix or a lot of them. I'd be scared if I were you."
"Hey, I can carry a big gun too. He's just a fat arse"
"Not pulling turns like that ya don't my little sparrow" Archeon retorted. Their ears must be excellent, Tom thought to himself. He could hear noises from the ones on  Archeons back but couldn't make anything out at this range. The booming voice of the dragons carried well though.
"Now Tom, you said something about walls having ears, should we put down?" Archon questioned.
"Sure, I had some questions for you lot and a proposition for this one" Tom replied patting Jarix on the back. "Looks like The Red Baron has about caught up too"

Tom had spent much of yesterday trying to figure out how to put a fishing rod together. He hadn't wanted to spend too long on it. It had been complicated a little by the fact that Wiperna had really wanted him out of the workshop and had been doing a poor job of hiding it. When Essy had swung by a touch later she had been somewhat surprised to see him and seemingly completely forgot what it was she wanted to say.
So all in all it wasn't hard to work out that they were definitely up to something, but he didn't know what. Nor did he think he wanted to know, since it seemed likely to be some sort of surprise. Though what they had in mind, he had no idea.
So with him gently evicted from the workshop, he had two choices. Go back to the smithy and risk his sanity, or go looking for somewhere else where he could get away with trying to put a fishing pole together. When he had remembered that nearly every tool in the keep was in one of those two rooms, he had swallowed his concerns and gone to the smithy. Perhaps he could get some guide rings made, or mayhaps a hook or two. If worst came to worst he could always just have a go with just a line and hook after all. It sounded easy enough, so he figured he would have a crack at that forging thing.
He knew everyone had always told him it was damn hard, but a simple hook? How hard could it be? He had watched Shiva work iron or steel a thousand times by now, so he ought to have picked up something by now, and she made it look so incredibly easy.
Roughly three hours later he was sitting in Shiva's rocking chair, pouring sweat, and watching Jacky make the simple little hook for him, with Tink and Twitch waiting their turn rather impatiently. Twitch was holding a by now truly mangled-looking piece of iron, Tink having had his hammer taken away by Jacky as she worked. To Tom, they looked like a pair of children waiting for their turn on the swing set, which he would have been laughing at if he wasn't so damn tired after fucking it up for what felt like the quadrillionth time.
His mood was only worsened when Jacky triumphantly put down the hammer after little more than 10 minutes of work and let the two eager men have another go at their project. She came walking back over to Tom holding up the very crude and certainly too large hook she had fashioned. It was so much better than anything he could ever have forged though, that was for certain.
"Tadaaa."
"That's just not fair," Tom let out as the hook was deposited in his outstretched hand. He rocked back in the chair while inspecting it closely, it would probably do the trick.
"No you just suck at forging… Kinda thought you would learn quicker if I'm honest," Jacky grinned, grabbing a cloth to wipe away at least some of the soot given off by the forge.
"But it just wasn't working. It would snap, not turn out straight-"
"Melt in the fire," Jacky added, referencing the few 'accidents' he had suffered when trying to heat the delicate piece back up again.
"That wasn't my fault. You got the forge too hot," Tom protested. He was certain that at least one of the times she had put on a big blow with the bellows which was not needed, leading to him just getting the end of his hook back out of the coals.
"No I didn't," Jacky protested, crossing her arms and snatching back the hook. "I kept it perfectly steady at all times."
Tom grumbled a little. He really wanted that hook. If it came to it he guessed he could make do without the rod, but he needed that hook no matter what. "Could you maybe harden and temper it? You know, in case you people are actually right about what's down there?"
"Uhm… sure I guess?" Jacky replied, looking at the small metal item. "Pretty sure you'll break the line first though."
"That is true… We also need bait and a pole for it. You know those little rings I talked about?"
"I ain't making those for you, get mum to do it, or use the lathe thingy. I'm sure we can work out bait though. What do fish like, hopes and dreams?"
"Baby children," Twitch merrily suggested, as the two started hammering away once more with no sign of a change in tactics.
"Noo noo, some kind of smelly meat should do well. Normally you would use some smelly fish, but- well, we're kinda short on that," Tom clarified, shaking his head.
"Maybe some old potted venison that's gone off?" Jacky asked curiously.
"That's the stuff where it's just in a claypot with something in the bottom and butter to seal it tight, right?" Tom questioned, trying to think back to some of the odder ingredients he had encountered at the keep thus far.
"Well you cook it first, but yeah pretty much. Smells like a rotten carcass when it goes off."
"That should do I guess… so rings and a rod to go then."
"As I said, I am not making those rings for you," Jacky reiterated, crossing her arms in defiance while still hanging on to his hook.
"Fine fine… I'll probably just ask Shiva. Might be a good idea to burn them onto the rod or something. Don't think we have any decent glue."
"Would hoof glue work?" Tink questioned as the now cold plate was stuck back in the fire. With a big yank, Twitch pulled on the bellows with reckless abandon, the coals spewing sparks and embers as they glowed nearly white at the center.
"What is hoof glue?" Tom found himself asking, having no idea at all really. The only natural glues he knew of were tree sap and that joke about boiling a horse down for glue, so maybe it was like that?
"It's made from hooves, connective tissue… Skin I think. All sorta connecty bits. We must have some, right?" The inventor questioned, looking to Jacky of all people.
"I think so, yeah? Kinda hard to make bows without it."
"Oooh right, composite bows, forgot about that," Tom let out as it clicked. He had no idea if that would work, but he supposed it was worth a try at least. "That still leaves the rod though?"
"You should ask Kullinger about that, even if you don't like him that much. Not that I blame you by the way. He would also know where the glue is."
"What about using an old bow for the rod? Surely you would have a broken one somewhere," Tink suggested as he stuck the metal plate back in the fire after checking how red it had gotten, Twitch continuing to pump away.
"Actually… that's not a bad idea," Tom agreed. "At least on paper. Well-seasoned wood, nice and springy, tough but light… yeah that should be perfect. You wouldn't happen to have a longbow, would you?"
"Like… a bigger one?" Jacky questioned, tilting her head.
"Yeah, but it's just wood. It would be taller than me," Tom went, holding up his hand to as high as he could without getting up from the really rather comfy chair.
"No…" she answered, a little unsurely. "Why would you want a bigger one? I mean, I guess it could look cool."
"Long story I guess. But a regular one will do, I think. Unstrung it's sorta straight, I guess."
"I mean not really, but I hate to break it to yah, that's also Kullinger you want for that."
"Fine, fine. Do you know where he is? What would he even spend his day off on if he's not down here?"
"Probably in his room praying or whittling away on something. Come on, let's check before those two cause a fire and it's our fault."
"Hey, I have worked here for months," Tink objected, looking up from his work. "Not once have I caused a fire… only minor explosions."
"Yeah, yeah, and that plate is gonna melt soon, even if it's just hot in the middle," Jacky retorted as Tom got to his feet, finding himself pushed towards the door with a slap on the bum, a snickering Jacky following behind.

Saph had gone to have a nap once they had finished in the library. She had just been so damn tired.
"Saph? You up still... Saaaaph?" came a tired-sounding call from outside her door.
"Who is it?" Saph replied groggily, not actually wanting to wake up yet. Nor did she care if anyone could hear that fact. She didn't even know what time it was, but there wasn't any light peeking in anymore through the narrow windows.
"Fengi… Can I come in?"
"Sure… didn't lock the door I don't think."
Sure enough, the sound of the latch sliding up was soon heard, followed by the door slowly creeping open. Saph turned around in bed to watch Fengi step inside, carrying a small oil wick lamp, closing the door behind her. "Shouldn't you be sleeping?" Saph questioned, peeking down the dark unlit hallway, the torches and lamps long since extinguished.
"Yeah… I should," Fengi replied, slack-eared in the dim light of the lamp. Her face was hard to make out, but she sounded ready to drop where she stood that much was clear to Saph. "I just… I was thinking…"
The young huntress didn't make it much further, seeming lost in thought or perhaps on the verge of falling asleep while standing. It was warm enough inside, so it at least shouldn't be the cold.
"Sit down Fengi… please. There's a chair over there," Saph tried, pointing into the darkness.
"Thanks," was all the reply she got, as Fengi went to fetch the chair, scooting it across the floor to sit down next to Saph's bed with a long sigh.
"So, what is it?"
"Saph, do you think Yldril tried to kill us today?"
"Uuuuh… no?" Was the best Saph could come up with. She wasn't even sure the dragon could. "She's under orders not to, she can't break that."
"I don't know… Do you really think it was just a mistake? Seems a little far-fetched."
"Even if she did try, she then saved us afterward. You weren't shouting any coherent orders as we slid, right?"
"... Probably not, no…"
"So she could just let us die then, right? If she'd meant to kill us to start with."
"I suppose… it just… felt off. How could she not know that would happen?"
"She's an arrogant bastard who thinks she's invincible and probably hasn't done honest work in decades if not a century?"
"Fair point I suppose…"
"What's got you thinking all this?"
"Just some things she said… Mind you, she had a really shit day today."
"She managed to get under your skin with something she said?" Saph countered, trying to sound disapproving.
"I suppose," Fengi admitted, ducking her head in shame.
"Oh come on, can't be that bad. What did she do? Make another threat? Tell you how dumb and stupid we all are around here?"
"No, she begged."
"For what? A bath?"
"Saph she wanted me to let her kill herself… I said no. She begged me to tell her to keep her head under the water till it was all over… She uhm… had a little snap I think we can call it," the young huntress clarified, not sounding too convinced in her own reasoning. It was certainly clear where her foul mood stemmed from now.
"Right… Well, it's hardly surprising. This whole thing is supposed to be a worse punishment than death. Or at least a more useful one for us," Saph replied, not sure what else to say. Yldril had been bound to service, and she had to serve or there would be hell to pay most likely.
"Could we not aim for the latter of those two? I think being a slave till forever is bad enough," Fengi countered. Saph couldn't give much of a counter. In reality she probably agreed with Fengi, but what more could they do?
"Fengi… Fen, we have treated her better than she has any right to. You have been better to her than pretty much anyone she could have hoped for. And she did ask for this it to put it fucking mildly… How is she now?"
"Brooding, I guess... Had her lay down on the other side of the keep so Glira at least can't see her from her spot. Else she would probably be mocking her all night."
"Probably yeah," Saph concurred with a nod. "Got any plans for what to do? She did seem a little more… well maybe less shitty is the word earlier today when we were camping. Maybe she's just having to deal with emotions for the first time in a while. That or she's trying to guilt trip you into doing what she wants."
"I don't know Saph. I just don't know… I'll just keep trying. With a little luck maybe she'll stop hating at least someone around here. That sure would help. Doesn't matter who, just someone who's on her side I guess."
"The easiest way to make someone open up to a person they dislike is to convince them you both stand together against something worse," Maiko then added from next to Sapphire, both women giving a start. Saph flipped around in the bed to look at the Royal Guard, who was just staring up into the ceiling without a care in the world. "Like grunts against the officers. Or Children and mums against stingy dads."
"You were here the whole time?!" Saph demanded in a forced hushness, not wanting to wake anyone up in case they had gone to bed.
"I didn't feel like the floor. Sorry," he replied with a dumb chuckle, turning to look Saph in the eyes. "Have I ever told you how fierce you can look in dim light? Enough to make my heart pound a little."
"Damn you and your magic," Saph grumbled, though she wasn't too mad. Not like he wasn't allowed in here after all, but he could have said something at least. She turned back around to look at Fengi, pushing up against him so she at least knew where he was. An arm reaching around her chest from behind, holding her gently. "Sorry about that, Fengi."
"Noo noo, it's okay… I just forgot. That's all," the young copper dismissed, though clearly seeming a little uncertain about the situation.
"I wanted to just be quiet and let you talk. But I'd bet you 5 copper the easiest way to get her to trust someone is to give her an ally. Perhaps not you though. Someone who can't actually do anything, but who agrees with her. Or at least pretends to."
"I guess so, yeah…" Fengi responded in a slow pondering voice, silence hanging in the air for a moment after. Then she looked down at Saph, lamp light glinting off her white snout, eyes dim in the shadow cast up against the ceiling.
"Uh-uh, don't you look at me. I'm not doing it," Saph countered, wanting to kill that thought dead before it could take off.
"You sorta did with Tom back when he arrived," Fengi tried, clearly looking to try and haggle here.
"Okay, first of all, we do NOT talk about that. Second of all, he's not an insufferable arsehole and a literal cold-blooded murderer."
"No, he's quite warm from what I hear actually," Maiko added in from behind her, giving her a little squeeze.
"Very funny… I'm not doing it."
"Well then who?" Fengi questioned, Saph spinning just her head around to try and look at Maiko, which only sorta worked. The corporal shuffled down a bit towards the foot of the bed, sneaking in under her head and pretending to not be there.
"Aren't you the guy Victoria used to do, literally this?" Saph questioned rather pointedly, Maiko pushing in further.
"Maaaybe," the guard replied in a far too childlike tone for Saphs liking. This was not a laughing matter after all.
"Maiko, please," Fengi tried, voice heartfelt and almost pleading. "If half of what Saph said is true, then I'm sure you would do great."
"Hey now, I'm not actually that great of a liar."
"I counter that one," Saph objected before he could carry on.
"Wow. What about Tom? He sounds like he's great at this stuff too. I mean just look at Jarix."
"I… We already have her working her butt off. That was about all Tom had to teach. Don't think that would do much with her… Please Maiko."
"Hooo boi. You know I do have stuff to do, right?"
"Like what? Spying on Paulin?" Saph questioned with a huff. She knew full well that Nunuk or perhaps Rachuck were making full use of their little spy. He was rarely seen actually working after all.
"No never. Who would ever be that reckless," came the reply, followed by a big overexaggerated sigh. "But fine… I'll try and befriend the murderous slave we have on hand. Just checking, she can't hurt me, right?"
"I don't think so, no," Fengi offered. Saph could feel him swallow behind her. "At least not directly."
"Perfect. I see no way this could possibly go wrong."

Tom could feel as much as hear the wind howling over them. They were all trapped under what they called a dragon tent. Tom called it a tarp, and it was barely being held up by a few rickety poles. It didn't seal properly to the dragon's back either, but it broke the worst of the wind as they flew. Snow was getting in, and freezing cold air. The only heat they had came from some small metal and glass contraptions that looked a lot like a lantern but were squatter. Thankfully they were able to burn more oil than a normal lantern, even if they did make some soot, but with how cold they all were no one cared. Tom had tried to move his arms and legs into a slightly more comfortable position while he waited for himself to freeze to death, but they barely budged. Everyone except the inquisitor himself was tied down tight. "You can't trust the grip of an ice shard," he had said with an almost evil grin as they were secured for that day's flight.
Tom was happy he had done it though. Or perhaps it was Joelina who had been so relieved after a patch of turbulent air had cost her footing, leaving her hanging from the ropes alone, not that they let her slide far.
He had lost all sense of time. The flight was supposed to be but a 6-hour hop, but that was before they encountered the storm. Neither Inquisitor Harvik nor Chaika seemed to care, simply letting the cadets know that it was going to get colder. And by the gods did his promise come true.
Tom had ended up so cold his or more accurately Joelina's memory had started to lapse. First in blinks, then a bit longer, soon he woke with a start only to find the light bleeding through the tarp had gone. His whole world was reduced to the glow of the oil burners, the constant howl of wind, and the incessant flapping of the tarps they were hiding under. He could not move, and he felt like he could barely breathe or look around. It was claustrophobic, and his mind was so slow he could not even panic.
Everything was cold, numbness, and deafening howling wind. No one was talking. No one bothered. He doubted he could even scream over the noise. He didn't have the strength. 'This must be what Dakota felt like back at the lake… only drowning too.'
When they set out, they had joked and jested about "How bad could it be?" They had the finest traveling clothes. Thick luxurious coats, hoods, even pants and foot covers. He couldn't really call them boots. But they were warm. They were lined with sheep wool and made from sturdy treated leather. He remembered a rainstorm they had faced shortly after departing the capital. It had barely fazed them. And here they were. A collection of barely breathing popsicles heading towards their new home.
The fortress of Gul Nyrelion.
"Ahr there we are! I was worried we missed it for a moment there!" Chaika called out, seeming to take delight in the storm, banking into a downward spiral. Tom could not see anything. But maybe it would soon be over. Surely it would be warm inside. People lived here. If only for three quarters of the year. A frozen bastion held by the Tikka family, supposedly tough as an old pulling harness, but not crazy enough to stay through winter. They were apparently paid handsomely to guard the northern approaches and provide a bastion where others may seek refuge should it be needed.
Tom had not even seen a painting of the gods-forsaken place, but it had been described as a low, fat, round tower with a few stocky buildings sticking out from its base. No more than 8 stories tall, not much for a keep, but it had walls as thick as any fortress ever built to keep the cold out.
Tom once again started to lose track of time. They stayed in the turn for what felt like an eternity, the constant turbulence throwing them around like a toy. An over 30-ton toy. And Chaika seemed to only grow more amused with himself as he came down for a landing. Suddenly they could see light, just a sliver, peaking out from under the tarp where it failed to seal.
Then they came down, draconic feet setting down in the snow with claws hitting stone underneath. The wind kept howling despite them being on the ground and slowly the dragon trudged forward towards the light.
Tom could feel his heart in the top of his throat. It was over. They were gonna get into the heat soon. They were not going to freeze to death. He just felt so relieved. Soon they could make out the clacking of winches working away as the light brightened enough that it almost started shining through the tarp. Willing his head to move, he looked around at the rest of the passengers. Glazz was lying next to him with a dumb grin on her face.
"Best wake up in a hurry cadet. You are on point, remember?"
He didn't even answer, he didn't even nod. He just stared at her and let out a tired grunt, head still resting upon the padded back of Chaika.
He had forgotten about that, and he could feel Joelina had too. Her heart started to pump faster as the howling of the wind was replaced with a bustle of people outside and the measured steps of the dragon. Light and heat rushed in faster and faster, his heart pounded until it was all he could hear. Joelina had to confront the lord of this keep. And Harvik had wanted it done as soon as possible. She was not fit to try something like that now. She needed rest. But would the inquisitor care? He had not seemed the sort to wait for others to keep up thus far.
"Do or die trying," had been uttered more than once upon this trip already… "You still in there?" Glazz carried on. Tom hadn't even registered that she had been the one speaking. "You're on, cadet. Get that shit off and Run some laps of the hall to warm up. Harvik will not be left waiting."
"U-u-und-d-der stood-d."

"And that is all you will need?" Dakota questioned, looking to Pho as she and Linkosta did the final rounds. They had apparently gotten confirmation that Archeon had indeed arrived in the capital yesterday evening after a rather lengthy detour around a storm had added another two days to the trip. But they had landed safe and sound. Once they had sold their cargo they would be ready to start acquiring their orders. By the sounds of it, Galaxer might need to help out. Cause there were a lot of wishes being made, and some of them were quite heavy. Others not so much. Like Pho's golden earrings, she wanted six of them.
'I guess her chances of ever making gilded aren't much, as long as she doesn't try for a golden tiara,' Tom chuckled to himself.
"No, I think that'll be most of it."
"I believe if you run out they will leave out what's on the bottom or the list or anything too hard to find."
"I get it, yeah. God this is so much harder than just swinging by the market."
"Quite," Dakota acknowledged, more busy with her clipboard and Tom's calculator. "Right next, Fengi did you have anything more? Last chance."
"Some waterproof playing cards would be nice… and dice box. I think I'm gonna be out in the rain a lot."
"Hmmm… What about your travel coat? We made that one right?"
"Oh Fengi, what about some more proper all-weather gear like the traders have," Bo added in, seeming quite enthused by the idea.
"Not a half-bad idea," Dakota agreed, seeming to ponder for a moment.
"I suppose so," Fengi said cautiously. Saph knew well enough what stuff like that tended to cost. A lot of work went into equipment like that, and she also knew Fengi had plenty of things she wanted to spend money on, not to mention keeping some held back.
"I will put it at the bottom then," Dakota went with a nod, throwing a quick glance at Sapphire, winking. "I already have your size, but we can always adjust it a little once it arrives."
Saph pulled a gentle smile looking to poor Fengi, who seemed resigned to the fact this was a good idea, despite the cost.
"What about you Saph. Any last additions?"
"No, just what's already on there. Have you got it all right there?"
"Indeed, would you like to check your shopping list?"
"Yes please," Saph replied, holding a hand out for the clipboard, which was promptly handed to her. With a quick look over her list all seemed to be in order. Some of that cider Ray had talked about. A flask or bottle of whiskey that would be just hers, and a silver ring with a sapphire in it. She just had to get that after all. There was a sapphire in her necklace, but it wasn't really center stage. This time it would be.
She had also taken a chance asking for a "Good book to read in winter, maybe something romantic." She knew this was Vulzan they were talking about here. So she wasn't expecting anything too extraordinary. Hopefully, there would be a nice woman working in a bookstore or stand where he goes looking to help him out.
"I think it's all there," she confirmed, handing it back to Dakota.
"Excellent. Anyone else?"
"Oh oh, a bottle of cinnamon whiskey," Pho added excitedly, Dakota looking a little less bemused.
"I see… I will add it at the bottom."
"Perfect."
With another glance around the table to see if there were any more last-minute additions, she had retreated back to the family table where Jortun just managed to get something added as well before leaning back in his chair, looking quite comfortable sitting next to Apuma. Nunuk was in her seat like in the old days, surveying the hall before her. Everyone was done with the food and some had even started clearing away plates and the like.
As the cleanup progressed the old lady stood up clearly intent on addressing the room, and everyone started to quiet down at least a little.
"Very good, I believe that concludes the shopping lists. Now for today, we will be sending out our first hunting party for a little while. We will not be able to do much to the construction site. Jarix is going with you, make good use of him. Gods know how many runs we will get in before the cold sets in. Saph and Fengi are staying here to recover. Tomorrow we will hold exercises with our allies here in the royal guard. Victoria too will be attending though without Baron sadly."
"So take a moment to freshen up your craft if you can find it. I would rather we not be humiliated tomorrow," the old lady carried on in good humor, looking towards Jortun who seemed quite merry at the prospect as well.
At the huntress table, they all started eyeing each other a little, many looking to Bo and Pho. The two had barely received combat training, not that it was their fault of course. Saph supposed it was 'better late than never,' but the tardiness would certainly show tomorrow that much was assured.
"I have also heard a little bird sing that perhaps we shall soon have another vault open. Likely the last before winter hits. We have little clue what lies inside, but I am sure it will be of quite some value to either us or the noble inquisition." This time the old lady looked to Paulin, who nodded courteously.
"I hope you enjoyed the time off yesterday, even if it did not quite go as intended. There is much to do! Spring to it and I am sure we shall have the time to take a slow enough winter, but hopefully not as boring as we are used to."
"Cheers to that!" rang out from the guard's table, the rest soon enough joining in with a varying degree of enthusiasm. All in all, spirits were high though. Not hard to guess why as everyone had just handed in the final few wishes for what they wanted, getting to actually spend some of all that money they earned. And, despite the trials of the last few days, everyone had made it back home in one piece. Only Yldril would need true recovery time. She would get however much turned out to be convenient, or just enough to see her airworthy, and that might even give Fengi a bit of time to work on her.
Tom was sitting at the huntress table too today, beside Jacky right at the end. He only half-heartedly joined in the cheer. He didn't seem happy or bubbly at all to Saph, nor did Jacky really. The two sat almost apart a little, and it was clear Jacky was holding him against her for pretty much the whole meal.
'Someone had a bad night again, I guess,' Saph sighed to herself, her own enthusiasm dampened a touch. A quick glance towards Paulin revealed that she most definitely was paying attention to the duo, which certainly didn't help Saph's mood. 'Oh you better not be to blame for this one too.'

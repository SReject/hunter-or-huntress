Tom and the others had ceased their chatting as the discussion inside the tent had started heating up, even if they couldn't hear most of it. Himself, Jacky, and Jortun were sitting around one of the small campfires relaxing a bit after a long day's work. Yldril was still sleeping soundly even as Glira's crew were putting the finishing touches on the latest set of bandages.
"I see why Essy likes Koko so much," Jacky said as she looked back over her shoulder at the tent.
"Knowledge is power," Jortun simply added, though clearly not pleased. "And that kid is an idiot."
"Unkai?" Jacky questioned, turning back to look at him, Tom also giving the major a curious glance.
"He knows what she can do. And he's scared."
"And what's that exactly?" Tom questioned, tilting forward, leaning on his thighs.
"That she can kill as easily as you can sneeze," Jortun replied flatly. "At least one day, if she's good at this."
"What? It's not like you can tell me to just break my own neck," Jacky scoffed, clearly not buying it.
"There is nothing voluntary about it if she's strong enough. He lost some grandparents to it. I ended up having to hunt down someone in the end… his grandma I think. She was apprehended by the city guard after the incident, and when she worked out what the likely sentence was going to be she used her magic to make a guard help her escape."
"Did she hurt anyone getting out?" Jacky questioned, suddenly seeming more interested.
"No. She was skilled and by no means as dumb as he is. She knew what her power could do. But apparently, she had grown complacent with it. She didn't respect it. As such, she made a mistake."
"A murder by accident then?" Tom added with a slight nod.
"In a sense. I was tasked with finding her. Which I did, eventually. She was a damn slippery one once she went on the run. But as far as I can tell, she didn't hurt anyone directly. I can respect that."
"So what happened to her? What might happen to Fengi if she slips up?"
"She was handed over to the Inquisition and posthumously executed for being a threat and a murderer."
"What do you mean postemusli?" Tom asked, looking to Jacky for an indication if he's fucked up a word that time.
"You cannot lock up people like that or sentence them to labor. It's either a slap on the wrist or the long way down. And if they know they are gonna die, they pose a massive threat to those holding them captive for even a short time. The verdict is made ahead of time and they then are hunted down and killed. Yet the body is still thrown off for the sake of tradition."
"Fucking hell," Jacky let out quietly with an understanding nod.
"And this makes Unkai an idiot how?" Tom questioned, hoping there was some twist to the story.
"Because the kid loves her. At least for now. She needs all the help she can get to learn to live with all this."
"And he's really not helping," Tom sighed in reply, straightening his back at the sound of a zipper. He and Jacky looked over their shoulders at the tent as Saph's head poked out.
"So is it a decent evening or how's it looking?" Saph questioned with a rather fake-looking smile as she exited, Essy following close behind.
"Not half-bad. I don't like the look of those clouds though," Jacky replied, glancing north.
"Well, it's too cold to sleep under open sky anyway," Saph sighed, going to sit down at the fire too.
"So. Anything interesting to talk about?"
They all stared at the tent for a second.
"You heard all of it didn't you," Saph then let out with a sigh, ears going droopy as she looked into the fire, Essy also sitting down silently.
"Did he at least smarten up a little?" Jortun questioned, his tone low yet serious.
"Well, he got in the bag with her. That's a start."
"A start," Essy added, shaking her head, Jortun just nodded.
"We were just talking about other enchantresses that Jortun here knows about," Tom replied, trying to sound a bit more cheerful, even if it hadn't been the most cheery of subjects thus far.
"Yeah. Like how many are there even?" Jacky questioned, clearly wanting to try and liven the mood up a little.
"I have no idea. What ones there are rarely disclose their abilities. Imagine a diplomatic meeting. Most people would be uncomfortable with having such a person present."
"Makes sense I guess… you don't even have a guess though?" Tom pushed. He really wanted to know just what it would mean that a talent was very rare. Was that tens, hundreds, or maybe even still thousands of dragonettes who could do this?
The major seemed to ponder it for a second before sighing. "I don't know. Maybe fifty, maybe a hundred. Maybe there are no more than ten that are actually practicing. I know of five now that are alive counting Fengi."
"And how many have you killed?" Saph asked, staring at him.
He just returned her gaze, not moving for a second or two. "Only one by my own hand. And I have a feeling most of the ones I captured are still around. They are too useful."
"Does that include… you know?" Tom went, giving a sideways nod towards the tent.
"Yes, I don't think she's dead. With how beaten up the body was they threw over the edge… It could have been anyone. But if so, she's now working for the Inquisition. Not the Royal court."
"Wait, what?" Saph asked, looking around at them confused.
"Unkai's grandmother. I would be willing to bet she still lives… at least if she hasn't died of old age or some other reason," Jortun replied. "I was the one that hunted her down back in the day."
"Do you think he knows?" Jacky asked, sounding quite conflicted right now as Saph just sat there pondering, Essy not looking like she knew how to take that either.
"No. Nor does it matter. I'll have a chat with him in the morning before he does any more damage. Might be able to spin a tale or two of the boons that can lie in store too if that girl plays her cards right."
"I wouldn't mind some boons," Jacky chuckled softly before looking back into the fire and unfurling her wings a little to catch more of the heat as the flames flickered. "Winds picking up again."
"I guess we should have asked Raulf if there was another storm coming," Tom sighed, looking up at the darkening sky. The sun was long gone, but it wasn't quite dark yet and there were certainly a lot of clouds to the east. "But I think we'll be fine on the boons front. We just need it to make it through whatever is coming."
"Either it rains or it doesn't," Jortun sighed, getting up. "I'll be in my tent if you need me. I wanna be up early tomorrow."
"Good night," Saph replied, scooting over to take his place, which had a bit less smoke blowing through it.
"So then… where are we sleeping?" Jacky asked, inching a bit closer to Tom, wrapping him up in one wing. "Your tent seems to have been captured already."
"Well, I thought they would be taking Fengi back home. And Saph too for that matter," Tom defended himself. How was he supposed to know?
"Infirmary is full and all the geeks who know what's going on are out here save for Apuma," Saph added with a shrug.
"Don't you think the poor guy is gonna feel lonely?" Essy asked with a careful chuckle.
Saph just snorted, pulling a smile. "Maybe. I think he's just enjoying the bed all to himself though. There are still some spots in there if people want," she continued, flicking her snout back at the tent.
"And some over in Glira's crew tent too," Jacky added.
"Oh don't make me sleep with the soldiers," Saph chuckled. "Maiko is bad enough."
"Oh no Tom, we're running out of tents," Jacky snickered, giving Tom a poke in the side. "WE don't want to sleep with the smelly soldiers."
"They fart and everything," Saph added, equally teasing. Essy just shook her head, pulling a smile as Tom did his best to sigh loudly.
"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Well, maybe one day we'll find a blueprint for a magic pop-up tent down below."
"Dibs," Jacky half-shouted, raising her head towards the sky just as the first drops started falling, her expression turning to one of defeat. "Ahr no."
"Yeah, let's find some cover. Think Glira would be helpful?" Tom asked, standing up.
"Only if you stop bitching about how I fight," the dragon rumbled, lying by herself a ways off, curled up on the grass. Her crew had seemingly abandoned work on Yldril likely due to the waning light, and with the coming rain, they were all making for the tents.
"If you will keep the rain off us, I'll make him shut up," Jacky chuckled, not getting up.
"A temporary truce then," Tom added with a shrug, looking at Glira, who had raised her head to look at him.
"Fine… just keep the fire lit. I'm cold too," she sighed, moving over in a few short steps and spreading a massive wing out over their little campfire. And don't burn me. That would be embarrassing."
"Yes, ma'am," Tom nodded in reply as the slowly dripping rain went away.
"Hah. Now we're camping properly," Jacky chuckled as she got up. "I'll fetch the bedrolls and sleeping bag."
"It will still get colder out there than in the tent," Glira added, looking down at them all.
"Jacky and I will stay outside. We'll be fine."
"Damn hot rock," Saph chuckled, looking into the fire and poking some of the stones on the brim with a stick. "I'll stick out here for a bit longer then head inside. The fire is nice."
***
"Good morning," Saph heard Fengi squeak out as she felt the younger woman stretch next to her. "What time is it?"
"Work time," Saph sighed. She really couldn't stay in here even if the tent was so nice and warm now that the sun had gotten up. It had sucked so bad that she needed to be woken up every few hours thanks to this whole concussion thing. She felt fine, if a little sick at times. But it had at least been an excuse to sleep in.
"Right," Fengi added with slightly less enthusiasm. "I guess we need to get to it… Where is Unkai?"
"Up and about already. He couldn't stay in here with us lazy girls after all. How are you feeling?"
"Better," Fengi replied, not sounding entirely convincing.
"It will be fine I'm sure… You basically just got blessed by a unicorn yesterday. Not many that can brag about that," Saph tried in her most encouraging tone
"I guess so," Fengi replied with a mild sigh. "Just saying that aloud sounds insane."
"If the church ever finds out they will make you a high priestess or something."
"Can't those only be like completely white people?"
"Albino… I don't know… I think they would make an exception for you though. Or come up with some other title."
"Imagine that… A street girl playing at being a priest."
"I think you would make a damn fine priest… Even if the robes would look ridiculous on you," Saph snickered, worming over and giving Fengi a poke with her snout.
"Hey! I think I would look great in one of those robes. Just think of all the snacks you could hide under there," Fengi replied with a snicker, turning over to look at Saph in her little cocoon of comfort with some effort. "No one would ever know."
"Maybe you can get a prayer started so you can snack in peace?"
"Oh, have jerky in the censer!"
"Oh they would kill you," Saph snickered.
"Not if I'm holy… Nah, I don't think that's worth the hassle."
"What, to have your every whim cared for?"
"No, to be surrounded by nothing but religious nutjobs all day long. I'm fine with a bit of praying, but…"
"Gonna be a bit much?" Saph tried, looking to give her a less heretical way out of that one.
"Yeah… Bit much," Fengi replied with a smile and a nod.
"Anyway. I think we do need to get going," Saph said as she went to extract the now cold hot rocks from her sleeping bag, all wrapped up in leather sheets and some extra cloth so as not to risk burning the precious human silk, nylon, or whatever it was.
Fengi also started to rummage around in her bag, and before too long Saph poked her head out the tent flap to see plenty of activity going on. Yldril was still just lying there, seemingly asleep. At the center of camp, Glira was also still snoozing, though people were already busy running around.
"Right, let's get a move on," Saph went, forcing some enthusiasm into her voice, climbing out and doing her morning stretches. Fengi followed suit, though a bit less enthusiastically.
"Good morning you two. Or noon. Feeling better?" Maiko half-laughed at them from behind the tent, surprising Saph.
"Well, I was till you showed up," she replied with a snarky smile, going back to her side stretches, Fengi just nodding.
"Dammit, I knew I should have stayed home. Are we ready to go?" he asked, looking at her and Fengi.
"I think so," Saph replied, looking at Fengi, who just shrugged and glanced at Yldril before looking at the ground.
"I guess."
"Oh cheer up, please," Saph tried getting her attention. "Please?" Fengi did pull a bit more of a smile, though Saph had little trouble telling it was fake.
"I'll let the old man know," Maiko added before setting off in a trot towards the larger tent.
The two of them had just started making their way over to Yldril, looking at the huge wounded dragon. "What do you think Kalestine did?" Fengi asked in a careful voice. "She really didn't feel happy."
"I have no idea," Saph replied truthfully, looking at the stricken dragon. "What did it feel like?... You know, having her in your head."
"It was so strange. It was like I was hearing everything she thought… well, feeling it more like."
"So you actually tried being in the head of a unicorn?" Saph asked, looking at her friend, brows raised.
"I think so?" Fengi answered meekly, looking like she shrank a little under Saph's stare. Saph quickly turned away, looking back to Yldril as her ears swiveled, picking up the sound of boots behind her. "Morning, Tom."
"Morning," Tom replied as she turned around, eyes locked on Major Jortun currently standing on top of Glira's head.
"The hell?" she let out, tilting her head at the odd display as the major stamped on Glira's face, getting only an annoyed rumble in reply.
"Someone is not a morning person," Fengi let out with a careful chuckle.
Eventually the major did succeed in rousing Glira, the old blue letting out one hell of a yawn as the major jumped off. "Right… who needs killing?" she questioned much to Saph's alarm as she looked around the camp, eyes landing on Yldril. "Right… Fucking hell, black bitch needs watching," she let out, getting to her feet before shaking herself awake for a second, livening up as she walked past them take up station on the far side of Yldril.
"Nothing like a bit of torture to start the morning."
Saph could hear Tom sigh next to her as the major came trotting up. Linkosta joining them as well, coming over, pencil already out. "Morning"
"Morning," they all replied before turning their attention to Yldril.
"Wake her up, would you?" Jortun said, looking up at Glira.
"Wait, just try with her asleep first," Linkosta added, holding up her hand. "You never know."
"Right… Well Fengi, all yours," the major replied, gesturing at the black dragon as he looked at Fengi.
"Okay then… Uhm, Yldril, wake up," Fengi tried in a careful tone, not getting a reaction.
"Perhaps just a bit louder," Linkosta encouraged with a delicate smile on her face.
"Right… Uhm. Yldril, wake up!" Fengi ordered more forcefully, the dragon's ears swiveling up listening to them as if by command Yyldril's eye shot open. It took a second to focus before her gaze turned to stare at Fengi otherwise not moving a muscle.
"Good morning," Fengi tried cautiously, waving at the dragon, not getting a reply.
"Try allowing her to speak," Linkosta added, sounding like she was barely containing her excitement.
"Okay… Yo- You may speak."
"I HATE YOU!" Yldril roared at them as she glared at Fengi.
"Sorry," Fengi squeaked out recoiling.
"Don't say you're sorry, she tried killing Nunuk!" Jacky protested, gesturing at Yldril. "She's a piece of shit, and she wants to kill us too I bet."
"More than you know," Yldril snarled, turning her glare to Jacky for a second before switching back to Fengi.
"Look. The way I see it… You just got judged by a unicorn for being an asshole. Yet she didn't kill you outright. So I think I kinda need to give you at least a chance now," Saph added, hoping to help Fengi however she could right now.
"You're fucking kidding, right?" Jacky questioned, a sentiment that seemed to be echoed by most of the people present. "Make her tell us what she knows and be done with her. Maybe just tell her to work the mines like a good little bitch till the day she dies."
"We don't know if it quite works like that," Linkosta added, for once looking rather conflicted.
"No, she thinks we're the bad guys, why not just show her we aren't?" Fengi protested, raising up her arms and her voice.
"We don't know if it works like that either," Linskosta pointed out.
"Kalestine did say servitude," Saph pointed out.
"Well let's find out then," Fengi replied, turning back to Yldril with seemingly renewed determination.
"So, Yldril. You are not allowed to harm ANYONE without me saying so. Do you understand?"
There was no reply as Yldril just glared at her, a slight smile creeping onto her face.
"Answer me when I ask you a question and you will tell the truth."
"I understand," Yldril replied clearly against her will as she snarled.
"Very good. Now I am not evil. But apparently, I'm now in charge of you, and I won't disappoint a unicorn. But if you keep being an arshole like this I'll be mean. But be nice, and I'll be nice too. This is a nice keep. We are good people, we have great fun and there is so much stuff happening. And you are going to help. Do you understand?"
Yldril just nodded in reply as Fengi took a deep breath.
"Okay then. So to get started, who sent you?"
***
"I don't know," Yldril replied cautiously before pulling an evil grin and glaring down at Fengi, who seemed to think for a second.
"Well, were you hired then?"
"Yes."
"Okay, by who?"
"I don't know," Yldril asked, her grin widening.
"Do you have an idea?" Fengi tried again after a second's thought.
Yldril tried not to reply, the words getting caught in her mouth, her grin disappearing. "Tsarina. Tsarina Kosvo… I think," she then let out, while looking for all the world like she would tear them all apart if she got the chance. "I HATE YOU!"
'Well that was easy,' Tom muttered to himself as he looked around trying to gauge if anyone recognized that name. The sea of confused faces left him to just sigh. 'Well maybe not then.' "Fengi, could you ask her who that is?"
"Uhm, sure," Fengi replied with a nod, looking back at him for a second before turning to Yldril again. "Who is that?"
Yldril once again tried to resist, though she did not last long before she answered forcefully. "Prominent member of the Engi-Engineering G-Guild," Yldril let out with a sigh before seeming to deflate. "Pompous arsehole with an affinity for backstabbing."
"Oh not again," Jacky let out before she and Tom locked eyes. "It's another damn Flaxen."
"Why did she hire you?"
"I don't know," Yldril replied, seeming to have given up on resisting.
"Okay, why do you think she did?"
"I have no clue. I was tasked to recover drawings, any odd-looking items, and a strange man named Tom… Alive…" she replied, her single eye locking on Tom.
"So it is not the Inquisition then?" Tom asked, looking at the black dragon, Fengi taking a second to catch on, relaying the question again much to Yldril's evident annoyance.
"Not, that I know."
"Well, that's something at least," Tom had to admit, thinking it over.
"Do you know, think, and/or believe anything else about her?" Fengi asked again, looking pleadingly up at the dragon.
"She is short like you and petite of build, fiercely competitive, very self-important, fairly rich, and a self-made noble. She has five kids, most of them still young. Is often seen with a young white female dragon who I believe is a kind of bodyguard for her. She also has guards with her much of the day. I believe she's paranoid after… taking advantage of so many people. She pays very well and might like purple."
"Purple?"Fengi asked, tilting her head as if that was the strangest thing in there.
'Fucking girls,' Tom just sighed, doing his best to come up with a solution to that whole situation.
"I saw her in a dress once."
Fengi just stared at her for a second before looking back to Tom and the others. "Will that do?"
"Well, I'm pretty sure that's all she knows," Tom replied with a shrug. "We can have a chat with Tink too once we get back. Ask her what she was paid,'' Tom replied, gesturing at Yldril.
"Right. What did they pay you?"
"Five hundred gold upfront, the promised there would be plenty of loot here that she cared little for, and five hundred more upon completion. She just wanted all the odd items and drawings. Nothing else."
"A thousand gold isn't much for two dragons and this much crew on a dangerous mission," Jortun added, Yldril refusing to respond.
"Isn't that like two year's pay for Jarix?" Tom questioned, looking at the major. He still had some problems working out what things were worth around here.
"Indeed, but that is with all his needs taken care of. And mercenaries rarely fly for honest pay," Tom kinda had to agree with that one. Killing for money was a lucrative business everywhere it seemed. Jortun looked back to Yldril, clearing his throat. "Well?"
She refused to even look at him, instead starting to scan around everyone else present, gaze lingering on Tom for a bit.
"Okay, either you answer him or I force you to answer everyone till I make it stop. Okay?" Fengi went looking up at the dragon. "Just play along."
"Never!" Yldril snarled in reply.
"Yldril, answer every question asked of you," Fengi went, looking both saddened and disappointed as she looked back at the Major. He just nodded at her with a somber expression on his face and repeated his question.
"I have worked with her before- AHRG! I hate you!" Yldril roared, though it soon turned into a whimper. "I knew this would be something special. The guy that actually came to hire me showed some of the things you had come up with. He told me of the guard stationed here. I knew you had to be sitting on something worth a fortune… all I had to do was snatch it."
"What exactly was the report on us?" Tom asked, looking at her curiously. He really wanted to know just what kind of image they had cultivated.
"One young dragon stationed at the keep, likely necessary to take out. One combat wing patrolling the island. Wait till they are out," Yldril replied with a whimper, though the snarl didn't leave her face for even a second this time.
"How long did you sit in wait?"
"Not over a week. I had two scouts check you out daily. Would have struck sooner if not for that blasted party you held."
"Hey, Yldril! Do you dance?!" Jacky asked with a cocky grin on her face.
"No, you little bastard!" she snapped in reply, the fire coming back into her eyes. "Not unless it's on your cursed and rotting corpse!"
"Oh? I think she did like the red guy."
"Jacky!" Tom snapped in reply, looking up at her and trying his best to look disappointed.
"She damn near killed Nunuk, I don't give a fuck about her feelings," Jacky replied flatly. "Hey, fuck face! How many people do you think you have killed?"
"Don't answer that," Fengi cut her off right as Yldril started to answer.
"What?!" Jacky asked, raising her hands in the air.
"Just… please don't," Fengi tried looking pleadingly back at Jacky.
"You aren't using your magic right now right?" Jacky asked, looking a touch perturbed at Fengi.
'Dammit woman,' Tom cursed to himself, not able to do much out of fear of making it worse.
"No… I'm not… I think," Fengi replied, looking down at the ground, ears drooping a bit. "Just… I mean come on, look at her. She can't do anything… and by the gods, it sounds like she'll be like this forever. Isn't that bad enough?"
"... Fine… But you better make her work her ass off or something if you wanna keep her as a pet."
"She's a person too gods dammit!" Fengi protested, looking back to Yldril pleadingly, the black dragon refusing to look at her.
"Just a shitty one."
"Yes… A shitty Person," Fengi snapped at Jacky with renewed determination, before turning back to Yldril with a stern look on her face. "Yldril, why did you do it?"
"I don't understand," the dragon replied dismissively, not acknowledging her.
"Why did you take the job… You're a damn dragon, and one that's apparently willing to fight too."
"That's debatable," Glira added with a huff as Fengi sighed, glaring at the blue.
"Why did you take the job? You didn't need to, surely," Fengi tried again, in a calmer tone.
"... Because it works," Yldril replied flatly, seeming completely disinterested.
"It works?" Fengi asked, looking a touch confused.
"I get what I need and want and it's just me. No arseholes to kick you out, or turn you down… no wheels to run in, no sleds and carts to pull. I go out. I do one job. And I sit back and relax for months."
"To make sure you are hard to find… no path to follow just one hit, then fade away," Jortun added, seeming more than a little understanding of what she had been doing.
"Yes… precisely," she replied, glaring at the major. "So precious little fuckers like you won't find me."
"I hate dragons like you… Damn shame Ylditz isn't here to shout at you. It's drakes like you that's the reason Tiguan can't set foot in a keep without hands landing on hilts," the major replied, his voice low.
"Boo-hoo. Grow a spine."
"Says the thief taking from those with the least to spare."
"Well, what the hell can I do about it, huh? Riddle me that you silver old mayfly. You want to send me to the mines and get your precious little reward?" Yldril replied mockingly
"No… this will be worse… and a good lesson for Fengi too, I believe. You have been sentenced to servitude. So you will serve."
"And in turn, she will be treated properly!" Fengi shouted back at Jortun, seeming to take a second to realize what she had just done. "...I'm sorry."
Jortun for his part did look stunned for a second before pulling a smile and nodding. "I think you will do well, Fengi."

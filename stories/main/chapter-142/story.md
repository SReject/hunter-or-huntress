'How do you even teach someone magic?' Saph asked herself as Fengi sat down on the floor in front of her chair. This was a job for someone like Apuma or Linkosta. They were trained in this after all.
Saph herself had just done a lot of trial and error. That was how she had learned, many nights spent sitting alone in her room trying basic things like moving a twig a bit or seeing if she could lift a feather. She still had that feather actually, come to think of it. That was neither here nor there though. She somehow needed to teach Fengi how to use her magic in the span of an afternoon, not months' worth of mucking about.
"Right, okay. Can you feel anything when you use it?"
"I don't think so?" Fengi replied uncertainly, clearly trying to think back.
"Okay… I'm fairly sure you should be able to, I certainly can. What did you do when you found out?"
"I shouted at Glira to stand up?" Fengi replied almost questioningly.
"That's a start. Try doing that to me then. Maybe try willing me to do something at the same time, I don't know. Try and see if you can feel anything when you do."
"Okay?... Sapphire, salute me," Fengi went, staring at Saph with what Saph would describe as murderous intent.
"That's not doing much if I'm honest," Saph replied, trying to feel if she all of a sudden wanted to do a salute while coming to terms with the very unfamiliar looking Fengi. She was always a happy face at the keep. Well either that or sad; she was so rarely angry.
"Maybe try asking nicely? That seems more… you."
"Aww. Thank you," Fengi beamed shuffling a bit on the floor before taking a breath.
"Would you please salute me, Saph?" Fengi asked with big puppy eyes, ears hanging down by the side of her face, head tilted slightly, hands held up in front of her and clenched together. She looked almost like a beggar Saph noted as she tried to feel if anything had happened, not noticing anything.
"Did you feel anything?" Saph questioned, looking at Fengi with a wide smile.
"I don't know… A little?" Fengi replied almost questioningly. "Did you?\`"
"Something I think," Saph lied, hoping maybe a bit of confidence would help.
"Ohh that's so awesome! Again!" Fengi went as she repeated the procedure, looking even more adorable. Saph felt like her damn heart might melt before she noticed her hand actually twitch a little.
'Wow… Fuck, she's not kidding,' Saph went to herself, looking down at her hand. She hadn't been expecting Fengi to be lying. But still, this was so rare from what she knew… she didn't even know anyone who could do that… well until now at least. "I think you want to focus on that feeling. You should be able to choose how much energy you are using."
"Okay. I'll keep trying," Fengi replied enthusiastically, closing her eyes as she tried again, this time seemingly to no effect.
Fengi kept at it, trying different commands, tones, expressions, and whatever else they could think of. Some made Saph's hand twitch a little, others achieved nothing no matter how hard Fengi tried. Maiko came back with rope and fire-starting supplies after a while, walking over to check upon them.
"So, how are you two doing?" he questioned, giving them both a nod.
"Nothing bad has happened at least, so that's good," Saph replied, Fengi letting out an annoyed sigh. "It's not doing much, to be honest,"
"Just keep at it. Trust me, I had a hard time of it too. Not the easiest thing in the world to know if people are able to notice you or not."
"I guess, but still. I feel something… Might just be making it up though. Maybe I'm so weak it's useless," Fengi replied, looking a bit disheartened.
"Oh come on you, you haven't even been at it for an hour yet. You'll get it, I'm sure."
"Thanks," Fengi sighed, though she was still smiling as she tried again. "Saph. Would you salute me? Please?" she pleaded, Saph sighing as she felt her hand twitch a little before looking to Maiko.
"Heard any news on Nunuk and Quinlin?"
"Quin lost a lot of blood," Maiko replied with a slightly strained expression. "She's gonna be in for a tough time. The two daughters are still working on Nunuk. They sound confident though, acid is all gone."
"Please don't tell me I might have gotten Quinlin killed," Saph all but pleaded, looking up at him as Fengi seemingly took a bit to collect herself.
"I don't think so… But you might want to consider helping tend her bedside for the next while. You know-"
"Try and make up for it," Saph cut him off, getting an affirmative shrug from Maiko.

Tom had been helping Bo with tying in the last of their rope over some of the padding from Yldril's armor when Anchor, Jacky, and Essy arrived. Tom stepped off the dragon, going to see just what they brought to help.
Jacky ran right at Tom as soon as she touched down, not even bothering to take off the two coils of rope she had over her shoulders. She yanked him off the ground, squeezing him till his back cracked, nuzzling his head rather violently. She didn't say anything, Tom wondering if her hearing had gone again as he returned the hug as best he could from his current position.
"I see you lived through that little stunt?" he asked as he gave the side of her neck a quick kiss. "You crazy woman."
"It was fucking awesome! Did you see it?!"
"I saw it," Tom confirmed in a strained voice, squirming a little in her grasp. The rope was rather uncomfortable, not to mention her breastplate. "Jacky. Hurts a bit."
"Oh shit, sorry," she went, putting him down and dusting off his shoulder like that would do anything. "Anyway, right, so I didn't even know if that would work, but remember that Tom Cruise guy you showed me. The impossible mission or something."
"Yeeess…" Tom replied, wondering just how that had anything to do with this.
"You know the scene with the plane right, where he hangs off the side?" Tom just nodded, a slight smile crawling onto his face. He loved seeing her this excited. More importantly, she didn't look like she had a scratch on her.
"I honestly didn't know if that would even work! He just came past and I went for it. I hung on with my knife… I bent it a bit. But it worked!"
"Oh Shiva is gonna be mad" Tom snickered as she drew the now crooked knife.
"Oh come on, I killed a dragon. She'll understand." Yldril seemed to squirm a bit on the ground, Tom glancing at her. She looked less than pleased to say the very least. Glira let out a low growl, baring her teeth in a sneer like a dog looking down at Yldril.
"Right, sorry I killed your friend. He was kind of an ass though," Jacky went, looking at the dragon a bit uncertainly before turning back to Tom.
"Anyway, so I shoot the bastard that was on his back with my shotgun. He goes fucking everywhere, right? Then the dragon snaps at me trying to eat me and I just scoot over to the other side of his back," she continued, actually laughing at the last part. "So I reloaded and moved up to the base of his neck. I thought about putting it into his neck from there, but I didn't think that would kill him," she continued, Tom shaking his head in agreement.
"No, I don't think so either."
"We might need something for that actually. Anyway. So I jumped onto his head. Did you see that?!" she continued, excitement nearly overwhelming her.
"Sure did," Tom chuckled with a wide smile.
"He tried to shake me off, but I was having none of it. So I just stuck my gun in his ear and pulled the trigger."
"Very inventive," Glira praised, looking down at the huntress.
"I know right! He was dead on the spot. Didn't think it would work that great. Like maybe a few rounds, but no! Instantly dead!"
"I think you pulped a good portion of his brain there," Tom replied, thinking that one over. "Yeah, that would do it I think… Hell, the pressure alone…"
"So in other words… I got you your trophy." She preened, resting her fists against her hips looking as proud as he had ever seen her. Tom wasn't quite sure what to say in this situation. He kinda wanted to scold her for being so reckless, but she was so damn happy. And there was no fucking way he couldn't agree that was awesome in the extreme.
In the end, he decided to just shut up, instead lifting the bundles of rope off her. Jacky stood looking at him in confusion until he leaned in against her chest, giving her a rather less brutal hug as he just held her.
"Aww," Jacky let out, patting his head ruffling his hair a little. "I might have broken the gun though."
"You what?"
"It blew up," Jacky went, showing him her lower right arm that she had been hiding till now. "It's not bad at all, just hurts a bit."
"Oh you lucky bastard," Tom let out, looking her arm over. Slight burns and a bit of blackening, though it had clearly been cleaned already.
"Well I did just kill a dragon."
"Damn right you did," Tom had to agree, giving her a fresh hug.
"Okay, I'm confused again now. She gets points for brutally murdering a dragon while I get scolded for taking one alive, just a bit too viciously?" Glira replied mockingly. "Come one?!"
"She's my girlfriend and she might have saved the keep," Tom retorted. "You didn't need to be brutal… Just let it lie," he relented. "You did a fine job too."
Glira just huffed looking at the few wooden planks they had brought. "Bring that over here. I guess it will have to do."
"Did you bring the mine?" Tom questioned, looking back to Jacky.
"Anchor has it," she replied with a nod, looking back at the man in question, who came walking over presenting the weapon very carefully, clearly not trusting it.
"Thank you very much. Now, time to get some insurance against… snapping," Tom replied, taking the mine and looking to Yldril, who was once again glaring at them, Glira tilting her head.
"What's that?"
"A bomb. One capable of blowing a dragon's head clean off," Tom replied pointedly while staring down Yldril. "Anchor, you hold the detonator. She does anything stupid blow her head off. Glira, hold her down, would you? We're gonna tie it to the back of her head."
"And you called me cruel," Glira replied, eyeing the device.
Yldril pulled her head back away from them a bit before Glira planted a foot firmly in her head, keeping her in place once again. "I recommend staying still for this one."

Maiko had spent a few minutes trying to convince Saph that Quinlin was gonna be fine and it wasn't her fault. She just sighed and listened to him. She knew it wasn't her fault. She had plenty of excuses. Didn't mean she couldn't have done better. She just comforted herself with the fact that the swordswoman should recover from blood loss easily enough.
Then she felt Fengi go and give her a tight hug, clutching tight around Saph's chest, head pushing in under her arm like a scared kid. "Oh come on. I'm fine, Fengi," Saph chuckled, wincing a bit as pain flared in some of her wounds.
"Please Saph, salute me."
'Come on Fen, that's damn near cheating,' Saph sighed to herself, as she turned down to look at the younger huntress, being greeted with the sight of her own hand coming up at remarkable speed.
"AOW!" she shouted out as she smacked herself in the face. Fengi went limp, her grip failing as she fell over backward, Maiko just managing to keep her from slamming her head into the floor.
"I guess she cracked it," Maiko let out, blinking twice as he held Fengi's head before looking up at Saph, who was just sitting there staring.
"I think so, yeah… Oh, what are you looking at?" she scolded, as Maiko began to snicker.
"I see you finally learned I outrank you."
"Oh fuck you. Is she okay?"
"She's breathing" Maiko confirmed after a brief check, Saph letting out a relieved sigh.
"What happened!?"  Rachuck questioned, running over, apparently having kept an eye on them.
"I think she figured out how to use more energy," Saph replied with a shrug, as she slowly managed to get her hand back down. "It worked very well though."
"Girl's a natural," Maiko chuckled. "I doubt she's coming back for a bit though."
"By the gods," Rachuck replied, rubbing his temples. "I'll fetch some water. We can't have her interrogate a damn dragon like this. I told you this was a bad idea," he went, gesturing at Fengi. "Also what if she had broken something in your mind, Saph? We don't know how this works."
"Oh now you have objections?" Saph asked in a mocking tone. "Well, do you have any bright ideas? Want her to practice on the prisoners? Doesn't sound much better to me." Saph snapped back at him looking at the prisoners out of the corner of her eye.
"No I… I'll… Just wait for Essy to fetch the mages, ask them... Jortun too for that matter. Maybe they know of a better way. Or at least if it could hurt anyone to keep trying. Aside from her passing out."
"If there was a better way to learn magic than just trying, I think we would have heard of it by now," Saph defended herself. It wasn't like she had a chance of knowing even if there was.
"For the record. I would call this one hell of a success," Maiko chuckled looking up at Saph as he picked up Fengi, moving her to sit against the wall.
"I guess so… I wonder if-Aouw!" Saph cursed as she smacked herself in the face again. "Dammit!"
"Oh no, did something happen?!" Esmeralda cried out. It sounded like she was in the grand hall, rapid footsteps now approaching. "Fengi!" she shouted out as she rounded the corner, dashing towards Maiko, who just held up a hand smiling.
"She's fine. Just a little spent it would seem."
"Oh thank the gods…Did it work?"
"Can't stop saluting," Saph sighed with a rueful smile. Vigon let out a snicker as Rakshaza peeked over Essy's shoulder, also letting out a little snicker and saluting Saph in return.
Essy just shrugged. "I had to let them know I was alright," she apologized, looking back at the clinging kid.
"Of course," Saph replied in a warm tone, willing her hand back down. "So I think this is progress, but the whole plan about going there right now might be a little problematic."
"I see. Well, I guess we have time to work on Yldril first then. Apuma and Linkosta are busy with Nunuk. Linkosta wasn't sure the trick with the horn could work if Fengi doesn't know what she's doing. She was willing to give it a shot tomorrow though. Oh, and while you might go a little weird in the head, it shouldn't be permanent. From what she read the effect doesn't last. Maybe avoid training on someone from the keep when Using Jinora though."
"We won't," Saph replied with a nod.
"And just don't let her order you to do something dangerous, of course."
"Of course," Saph echoed, looking down at Fengi before taking a second to consider what would happen if Fengi told someone to slit their own throat. A chill ran down her spine, 'imagine if that Flaxen bitch could have done this.'
"Everything alright?"
"Yeah, just dandy… We'll take her up to my room so we can keep an eye on her."
"Good idea. Would you mind taking her?" Essy went, holding out Jinora, Saph taking her and putting the toddler down on her good leg. "I'll find a cradle for her."
"Probably smart," Saph went, tickling the kid a little and getting a happy little shriek in reply, though the toddler's smile vanished as she looked up at Saph's bandaged face. "It's Sapphire. Don't worry, I'm not scary," she went in the most reassuring tone she could, sticking her tongue out a bit before trying another tickle. She got another giggle from Jinora, though she kept looking at Saph's face.
"Don't worry, Saph. I'm sure you'll still be the envy of all the girls when you get that off," Essy chuckled as she walked off with Rakshasa making his way around into her arms.
Saph just rolled her eyes at her, looking back to Jinora. "We need you to help us, okay? We need your magic. Remember that? Magic."
"Ganik," came the cute little reply followed by a proud little shriek from the little dragonette.
"Very good," Saph praised, giving Jinora a finger to play with as a reward. "Magic."
"Ganik," came the reply again followed by the cutest little laugh.
"Okay. Now. Sapphire," she went, pointing at herself.
"Ray," came the proud reply, Saph tilting her head before letting out a little sigh, still smiling.
"Seems you have been outdone," Maiko chuckled, giving Jinora a little head scratch.
"Haha funny," Saph chuckled, bouncing Jinora a little on her leg as the two played. "How are you holding up, Jarix? Done trimming yet?" Saph questioned, looking up at the dragon as she kept bouncing the baby.
"I'll live. It hurts so bad though," the dragon all but whimpered, looking like he was struggling to hold it together right now.
"Bad news," Radexi went, walking past Saph towards the dragon while carrying two buckets of soapy water and brushes. "It's about to get worse."
"Oh, this is going to suck," Jarix let out, ears flattening completely to the back of his neck.
"Afraid so," Zarko confirmed, looking to Saph. "You might want to go someplace else with the little one. This is not going to be pretty." The sight of the lieutenant walking up to Jarix's head holding a large log convinced Saph it was probably for the best to get moving. They really needed to get Fengi into bed too.
"Come on, Maiko. I need you, bud," Saph went as she moved to try and get up.
"Bud? Have I been demoted?" he chuckled, helping Saph to her feet. "I'll come back for you sleepyhead, don't go anywhere," he went, looking at Fengi who seemed to be fast asleep, tongue hanging out a little.

"They are gonna be a bit," Jacky announced as she set down with more supplies for patching Yldril back up. Mainly more planks, a hammer, and nails for making the splints for the busted wing limbs.
"Are they having trouble?" Tom questioned as he helped her place down the planks in the correct position. He still didn't get how she could fly holding on to something like that, but with a falling start it seemed to work. No doubt she couldn't take off normally with them though.
"Fengi fainted, and Saph apparently got stuck saluting," Jacky replied with a shrug, looking like she didn't understand that either.
"Okay… Not the best of starts," Tom replied. He felt the wind coming from Yldril as she sighed a sigh of relief.
"Don't you feel smug just yet," Esmeralda went, looking at the black dragon. The huntress had been entrusted with the detonator for the time being. The mine was currently lodged and tied in place between the dragon's horns on the back of her head.
Yldril didn't respond, obviously, her mouth having been tied shut.
"It happens," Glira added from above as she worked on the leg, trying to set the bone, which looked really hard to do when you didn't have thumbs. Yldril's smug demeanor was soon broken as she winced in pain again, Glira likely having done something unpleasant.
"That's what you get," Tom sighed as he got back to work. "Any idea how long till we can get a try in?"
"Well she kinda has to wake up first."
"Fair enough. So. Is someone camping out here then?" Tom questioned, looking up at the sun, which was starting to hang a little low.
"Well, I heard somewhere you might want to try camping under dragon wings," Jacky let out, giving him a little poke to the side.
Tom just looked at her rather unimpressed. He would have preferred to go back to the keep. Both to see that red up close and check up Jarix and the others. Specifically what the fifty cal had done and the burn wounds. Perhaps have a look at the brigands too for that matter, to see how the shotguns had performed.
"But then I wont get to see your trophy," he tried, doing his best to sound devastated.
"Shit, that's right… It's really nice actually. He was a fine young lad… well, until I blew his brains out."
"Of course, only the best after all," Tom chuckled, wondering just what they were gonna do with that thing. He had looked big. Bigger than Jarix that was for sure, and he was now a trophy he guessed… was that okay?... Could you hang a sentient thing from a wall?... It seemed like that was not something you would do.
Tom pondered it for a second before deciding he might as well just ask. Surely he was surrounded by people who would know. "What are we gonna do with a red dragon corpse anyway?"
"I don't know… The head would look nice in the grand hall. Remind everyone who comes to visit not to mess with us," Jacky let out proudly.
'Yeah, I should probably have guessed that,' Tom went to himself, not quite sure if he agreed with her on that one.
"Maybe tap off some blood? I'm sure Linkosta wants that, maybe some other bits and pieces… I wonder if you need bits of red dragon for that potion you bought way back when?" she carried on, seeming to ponder that last one for a second.
"Oh right, those things," Tom replied, thinking back to the flame breath potion that he had bought off of Archeon months ago. "I really should have brought that one, shouldn't I?"
"You sure it's safe for humans?" Jacky questioned, looking at him skeptically.
"I guess not… but how would I ever find out?"
"You're starting to sound like Tink," Jacky replied as she started hammering the board in place.
"Well else could I-"
"Tink, Hansen," Jacky cut him off with a snicker as she got out more nails.
"Or Tom the hypocrite," Glira added. "What was that about camping?"
"Oh, he was just sad he didn't get to camp out with Jarix and Tiguan a few days ago," Jacky replied before Tom got a say in the matter.
"I just said that sounded cozy," Tom protested, holding up his hands. Jacky tapped the board where he had been holding with the hammer, Tom dutifully getting back to holding it in place.
"Which means you wanted to try it," Jacky replied, clearly unfazed as she kept working. "Glira, we are gonna need something bigger if this is going to hold."
"Well maybe I can find a big tent pole somewhere," Glira joked before turning to Tom. "Do you trust in that device of yours?"
"Yeah, it will work," Tom replied with a nod, not wanting to show doubt in front of the dragon, likely doing calculations right now on whether running could somehow work out for her.
"So I will be able to go fetch some heavier materials?"
"Sure. I brought Saph's shotgun," Jacky replied for him, looking up from her work, pulling a smile that let a nail fall out of her mouth.
"I'll keep the rifle trained on her remaining eye just in case," Tom added with a sigh, looking at what they had been building. The boards were fine for some of the broken bits of Yldril's wings, but not the main bones of her legs. They needed big beams for that, which only a dragon could possibly carry… well unless he got out the quad bike. "I could probably drag them here otherwise."
"Nah, dragon is faster than dragging," Glira chuckled, looking down at their work. "I'll get to it."
***
Saph winced as Jarix roared out again, the sound only somewhat muffled by the log he was trying to chomp down on. They had moved to her bedroom, but they could still hear it reverberate throughout the keep. 'Poor fucking bastard,' Saph thought to herself as she looked at the still sleeping Fengi to see if the noise had woken her up this time.
It would seem not as the rather serene looking Fengi didn't even stir on the bed. Saph could still see her chest moving up and down, so all should be well on that front. If anything Jarix cries alleviated them of the need to try and wake her up. Saph sure couldn't sleep through that noise. Arguably more incredible was that Jinora was also still sound asleep in the cradle Essy had brought up to them, though the toddler let out an odd little sound every now and again.
For now, Saph and Maiko sat and chatted about everything that had just happened. All the kills dropped on the way back. What had happened back at the keep while Saph was away and so on.
Unkai had dropped by to check up on Fengi once he learned what had happened. It was only a short visit though, as the healer was rather desperately needed to help tend to the brigands; apparently one more had already died of their wounds, though another two had been found in the fields. One had limped back to the keep to surrender, the other being spotted from above by Anchor as he came back for more supplies.
Saph and Maiko had assured Unkai they would take good care of her and that they would let him know as soon as she woke back up again. Saph had tried to convince Maiko to go help out the others since hands were clearly needed. He had point-blank refused, stating he had been told by Kulk to keep an eye on her, so he would do so.
It wasn't like she minded the company. He took her hand, looking into her eyes with a warm smile. "I bet you're gonna look so badass when that eventually comes off."
"Now you are just trying to make me feel better," Saph replied, not sure if she should sigh or chuckle.
"No, think about it. You are gonna look like a warrior princess or something."
"You think I look like a princess?" Saph chuckled. "Come on, dude."
"No, I guess that's not fair… Your jaw is straight after all. Not some poor inbred fucker," Maiko chuckled as Saph shook her head, actually letting out a snicker at that.
"Classy. Better not pull that one with actual royalty around. Have you met many princesses before?" Saph questioned, leaning forward. "I guess I kinda have."
"Not met as such… I did shake hands with Aquilani once. She's a tough woman too, that's for sure."
"Not all show and no go then, I take it?" Saph questioned, leaning back in her chair with a warm smile on her face.
"Hell no. She'll rip you apart. She's the one that taught me that joke though."
"Sense of humor too then. I think I'm outmatched," Saph joked, thinking back to when she had sort of met that particular princess in the war room of the Royal Palace.
"Oh gods no. If you ask Victoria then she's not the smartest, and certainly not the calmest, but only the dumbest would ever challenge her to a straight fight. She's a telekinetic like you actually."
"Oh?" Saph questioned, taken aback. She wasn't quite sure what to think of that particular piece of news.
"Bloody good one too. Then I guess that comes with being a Leviticus. That and I'm sure there's a bit of unicorn horn at work too. Or maybe an expensive potion or two, you never know with people like that."
"What has her family got to do with it?" Saph questioned with a head-tilt. "I've always been told it's random."
"I don't know, but I haven't even heard of a member of the royal family that didn't excel in magic. She can push you to the ground with nothing but a flick of the hand. Saw her do it in a duel once."
"Just like that?" Saph went, doing a dismissive motion with her hand, looking skeptically at Maiko.
"Yup, just like that," Maiko confirmed. "It was just a sparring session I think, but still. I was damn impressed."
"I might need to spend more time with Jinora," Saph mused, thinking of just what she might be able to achieve with that kind of power. Sure, she could probably move someone a bit if she wanted to, but not without ending up like Fengi.
"What do you think would happen if little Jin gave you a boost?" she asked, looking at Maiko.
"I don't know… Go invisible maybe," he joked, looking at the little kid.
"Hah. And before I know it you've stolen everything I own and I'll never see you again.
"Oh please… I just want your heart."
"That… was terrible."
"Really? I thought it was quite endearing," Maiko let out, suppressing a laugh.
"The floor is still an option you know."
"Not if I have your heart it's not. I think you need that."
"I don't know, I've met some really heartless bitches over the years."
"Now now. You mustn't talk about yourself like that, young lady," Maiko replied with a joke, standing up and doing a rather well-honed impression of an old aristocrat.
"Lady? I don't seem to recall dumping you for some prancy noble recently?"
"Hey now, I'm very noble, and I can prance with the best of them"
"Compared to… never mind," Saph replied, looking at Fengi. "What does blood matter anyway?"

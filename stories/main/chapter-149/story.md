Well, showing off the computer had taken quite a while. Notes had been taken in great quantity as well, Edita almost managing to remind Tom of Linkosta when something new was brought up. They had been interrupted by the arrival of several boxes of inquisitorial goodies, so they had started putting things away. Goodies in this case meant some of the finest tools Tom had ever seen. Even the damn brass hammer she had brought was engraved with magic runes and polished to a mirror finish.
'Oh, when Shiva gets back up here… oh boi,' Tom thought to himself as he pried off the lid of another crate. "Oh, this is brilliant. A micrometer."
"Indeed. It is one of our most sacred instruments. Without it we can't ensure we are following the holy scriptures."
"You mean designs."
"They are ancient, possibly older than any living being. Not slapped together yesterday," Edita replied with a slight frown, going over to the workbench and inspecting the half-finished shotgun. "It's so different though. Rough and ready, the finish looks like an afterthought."
"Yup. Just good enough to work," Tom replied. "More than that is a waste of time."
"You would get beaten severely for having this on your bench back in the capital."
"I guess Shiva would like it there then. Everything polished to perfection."
"And machined until you can't measure the difference."
"You know I made all this hoping to help your people start industrializing. You know, get better lives?"
"Machines are expensive. Most people would never be able to benefit from them."
"With machines comes more and better machines. Cheaper too. In my world marvels like this are at the fingertips of everyone. I don't see why we can't make that happen here."
"I see… The marvels of technology brought to the masses… all hail industry." Edita's expression went a little vacant as she stared at nothing before snapping back to reality. "Well, I'm here to help innovate for once in my life. We will be walking a thin line to be sure."
"And if the wrong people find out it's not good?"
"Nope. I once got put in a cell for a month for trying to design a new focusing lens."
"You're kidding, right? Just for an experiment?" Tom let out. If that was true, the line they had to walk might be thinner than he thought.
"Yes… Something about how I didn't understand the purpose of the part. The head artificer on the project claimed that if the weapon had been fired with it installed it could have destroyed it."
"Well, I guess that does make a bit more sense… Was this one of those big weapons?"
"A bright lance, yes."
"How do they work?"
"Now that's a question and a half…" Edita replied, seeming to ponder for a bit as she put down some tools on the table. "It draws power from the central hub under the Royal Palace, deep inside the cliff. The energy is dumped straight into light and heat. You can't make matter with magic, but magic is just a form of energy you see."
"I think I follow," Tom replied with a nod, feeling like maybe he was the one that should be taking notes right now.
"The energy is directed through a series of arcane lenses. There we can change the focus and the size of the beam. The entire contraption is fixed on a large rotating mount to make it possible to point it."
"How big is it?"
"What were your unit conversions again?" she asked, taking out her little booklet and paging through it. "Arh. 4.69 meters long and 2.45 meters tall."
"You know your stuff," Tom went with a nod.
"I worked on that weapon for most of my life. I know every nut and bolt."
"So… you know how it works?"
"Of course?"
"Could you make one then"
"Here? No way," Edita laughed, gesturing around at the workshop. "I helped with the project to create some for Cartahega. we've been working on that for decades. Largest manufacturing project of our generation"
"Didn't sound like those weapons were gonna be coming back to Cartehega from what Paulin said?" Tom replied curiously. 'I guess they do try to fight back a bit then.'
"Well, why would she know? Besides, the problem is the energy supply. The lances have been ready for years. First one was completed before I even earned my cloak."
"Your cloak?"
"Yeah, this thing," Edita replied, billowing her cloak a little. It looked almost like flowing mercury in the light coming in the window.
"Is that like your rank then?"
"It means I'm an artificer."
"Sooo… what's the mark of a tech-priest? Or Priest of technology?"
"Nothing. You will never know unless you have to. Some random preacher might be one. It's basically everyone in the church or Inquisition who's allowed to handle our sacred lost technology."
"Which is another reason why you are here?"
"As well as the two that will be assisting Paulin. But yes, I'm here to make sure our lost artifacts are treated properly," she replied with a smile and a slight bow.
"So those lances of yours… what can they do?"
"As far as I know, cut through anything you can see and hit. We can't test fire for more than a few seconds because we can't lift up rocks big enough to survive it
"Yeah, I can see why that would be useful… and the power source?"
"In the capital, we call it the core. It draws magic from the entire surrounding area. by our best estimates up to ten kilometers out."
"So… keep firing?"
"And everyone is dead," Edita finished, not seeming perturbed in the slightest. "That's not even the worst part. That has to be the shield for the central spire. I've never even witnessed that thing turned on. But I know one like it was used in the battle of Cartahega, only their core wasn't quite as big."
"Wow… wait, you have shields? Linkosta said that's impossible."
"Sure it is… with her magic," Edita chuckled as she walked over to the half-built shotgun, running a hand along the barrel. "We don't have any of that here… But Joelina gave me free reign to innovate as long as it stays here. I will figure something out."
"Well, we are making production equipment, not arcanely enhanced shotguns. And personal shield generators."
"I think Joelina is crazy for trying this. But people are getting desperate. Maybe it's a chance we need to take. I don't care, I think this is the most exciting thing I've ever done."
"Well. pardon me for asking, but if you can already make machine parts, what do you need a machine factory for?" Tom asked, hoping he might get a bit more detailed answers out of Edita.
"For this," Edita replied, gesturing at the shotgun. "To make something new. Even if they manage to agree on letting us innovate, that is still a fair way away from letting the holy sanctums of the tech-priests produce holy artifacts for our people and armies. That will require more work. And we would be slow… glacially slow." Edita grumbled turning her attention not leaving the crude shotgun.
"So we are the next best thing?"
"Not just that. This is a long-term solution. The restoration of technology to this world. The fires of industry lit anew. The coming of a new age," Edita replied reverently as she looked at the homemade lathe that hadn't even been painted.
"I'm gonna need some kind of nap time."
"You can sleep when you are dead," Shiva then interrupted, bursting in through the door with another box and looking around. "Someone is busy making themselves comfortable?"
"Yes, master smith. I must say this is a fine forge for the frontier."
"Yup. Sure is," Shiva replied, setting down the crate and peeling the lid off with her own hands. "But this will make it even better."
"What is it?" Tom questioned, going to have a peek inside.
"Files," Shiva replied with a wide smile on her face."
"Oh yes, those. I didn't know which ones you might have, so I just brought them all."
Shiva picked on out of the straw-filled box. "It's beautiful… is this enchanted?" Shiva asked, tilting her head as inspected the exquisite-looking tool.
"Why of course, can't have a faulty file leaving scratch marks," Edita replied as if that was perfectly normal.
"Incredible," Shiva let out, running her fingers along it.
"Got another one," Jacky then added, stepping in the open door with yet another crate. "Where does this one go? It was just labeled something I couldn't read."
Edita walked over, taking a quick look at the box. "Alloys. It's bars of metal, some quite rare. Be careful with that."
"Hey, a bar of copper doesn't break easy. What did you do to her?" Jacky replied delicately, putting the box down and looking at her mother. "Also, that's not how you spell alloy."
"It was," Edita replied with a smile.
"They brought enhanced tools, Jacky. Look at this," Shiva almost chirped, turning around to show off the file to Jacky.
"Ooh pretty."
"I've not seen her this excited since… well ever actually," Tom chuckled, looking at the old smith who didn't even acknowledge the joke as she carefully put the file away, picking out another one.
"Where would you like these, master smith?" Edita questioned, holding up a selection of small hammers and one big one.
"I-" Shiva let out, looking up from the box, eyes locking on the large mallet-looking hammer. She then straightened her back, walked over next to the anvil, and removed one of the forging hammers, putting it in a box under a table before walking back over and holding out her hand for the large inquisitorial hammer.
Edita just shrugged, handing it over, Shiva treating the implement with near-religious reverence as she walked back over to the anvil and hung the hammer on the wall. "There."
Jackalope just leaned in, whispering to Tom. "I think she has a new favorite."
Tom just nodded, whispering back. "Where is Tink?"
"Oh I think he's organizing inside the workshop."
"I'm gonna go keep an eye on him. Edita, why don't you and Shiva figure out where everything goes. I'm gonna go make sure our inventor doesn't get too curious with anything."
"Sure. Let him know I want to pick his brain too later. He sounds interesting," Edita replied as Shiva simply nodded without looking at him, picking up another hammer and looking at a wall with too little space on it, seeming conflicted on what to do.
As it turned out, Tom's decision to let the two craftswomen sort out the tools in the smithy was an excellent idea. As he stepped in the door to the workshop, he was greeted by Tink examining a very intricate and delicate-looking piece of who knows what.
"I think you should put that down," Tom went, looking at the Inventor, who in turn just turned to look at Tom.
"But I just picked it up? Where do you want it?"
"Just put it on the table gently. We have no idea what that does."
"It's probably fragile too," Junior added, clearly sharing Tom's concern, the kid currently trying to put an ornately decorated box up on a tall shelf.
"It said 'Acronometer' on the box," Tink continued as he held it up for a closer look.
"And you think I know what that means? Jus-"
"Well I don't," Tink interrupted, lowering the thing back down and turning it over in his hands.
"Just put it on the damn table, Tink."
"Fine, fine. Could you get the artificer? I want to know how this works."
"I think she's busy reorganizing Shiva's hammer collection."
"If you don't get her, I'll start pushing buttons"
"I'll be right back," Tom replied, turning back to the door to fetch her only to watch it swing open as Edita strode in carrying a usb stick.
"What is the purpose of this item?"
"I was just about to ask the same thing," Tink went, gesturing at the device on the table.
"Oh that thing? It measures resistance in runic inscriptions."
"Fascinating."
"And what is this, Tom?"
"Data storage… that one has kids' movies on it?"
"Why was that in the forge?"
"I was trying to make a translation, it's sorta working… it's just gonna be a lot of work."
"Translation?"
"You haven't peeked in any of my books yet?"
"No… you write in a different language?"
"... Yes…" Tom admitted after a bit of hesitation, not quite sure he was prepared to answer that one.
"Curses that aren't allowed near the machine!" Edita let out in pretty evident frustration.
"You okay there?" Tink questioned, tilting his head, looking at her.
"I'm fine," Edita replied with a very false calm. "So. How hard is this language to learn?"
"I mean, by now Saph and Essy might be able to take you through the basics."
"Where is this Saph? I have to schedule classes."
"Uhm… I'm not that bad at it either," Tink let out, looking at her, the artificer's head swinging around to look at him. "It can get a bit boring to just be working the machines all day… been doing a little reading… I suck at speaking it though."
"It's a spoken language too?" Edita asked, gaze snapping to Tom.
"Selvfølgelig," Tom replied in Danish, trying not to smile at the lack of comprehension on their faces.
"What did he say?"
"That wasn't English," Tink protested, glaring at Tom.
"No, but he can actually read a bit of English. Might help the two inventors get to know each other too,"Tom admitted, turning to Edita. 'And make it not my problem if Tink breaks something for at least a bit.'
"We will discuss the rest of the languages you know later. Inventor? You're Tink?" Edita asked, eyes locking on the diminutive man.
"That's me, yes," Tink replied with a nod, looking a tad perplexed.
"I remember you from the report… Oh, I have so many questions for you as well. I've never invented anything before… Not really at least. Just slight modifications of existing components."
"Dad's your guy then. He can't stick with an idea for long enough to make it work right, but he's got plenty," Junior joked, receiving a stink-eye from his father.
"I believe I can be of help with that, yes," Tink answered, raising his chin a little, looking at Edita. "I have invented many things over the years."
"Okay, so. How would you structure an enchantment to heat a cutting edge to the point the metal turns liquid while still keeping the structure of the blade?"
"I… I made a rotary washing line once," Tink stammered out, looking at her, clearly not quite expecting that. "But… why would you even use a blade in that case? Or even why heat your weapon. I would heat the target instead.
"That's just a bright lance at that point."
"Well, what's wrong with that? Didn't the investigator that wanted to be a priest say you have something called that already."
"Because a bright lance uses enough magic to burn through a small village in a couple seconds."
"Oh… I may have some more questions."
"Of course you do. But mine first."
'Thank goodness, they are self-sustaining,' Tom thought to himself, letting out a relieved sigh and looking to Junior. "So kiddo… enjoying all the soldiers around?"

Saph had chosen to stay behind after the inquisitor left, mainly as an excuse to have a chat with Fengi, something which was quite clearly needed.
"So… that wasn't so bad," Essy had opened as soon as Joelina was ascending back into the sky aboard Baron, the venerable red having done nothing but sit and scowl at Yldril the entire time.
"No… I guess not," Fengi replied meekly as Unkai quickly walked up, putting an arm around her shoulder and guiding her back to camp.
"Come on, let's go sit down for a bit."
"Good idea," Essy echoed as Saph just followed along, keeping an eye on Yldril the black dragon clearly tracking them as they walked. 'You're a piece of shit… but not without reason,' Saph begrudgingly thought to herself, doing her best to win the staring competition.
They had gone to sit down at the small campfire. It was currently nothing but a pile of burnt-out chunks and ash, but the weather wasn't half bad, so relighting it could wait till evening.
"So. How does it feel having met an inquisitor?" Saph said, sitting down, hoping to lighten the mood a little.
"I think you did very well," Unkai added, giving her a little squeeze.
"No no, it was fine. I was just a little scared, that's all," Fengi replied.
"Hey, that's fine. But she clearly trusts you… at least enough to not start prying around in your mind," Saph mused, trying to keep it light.
"Think she's scared of upsetting Kalestine?" Fengi asked, looking up at Saph.
"I mean, it's possible. Think of it like that. You have a friend that outranks an inquisitor."
"And a big scary dragon," Unkai added with a nod. Saph narrowed her eyes a bit, trying to gauge him.
'He's still scared,' she concluded, turning her attention back to Fengi. 'Noble effort. Here's to hoping she won't notice.'
"I didn't ask for either," Fengi replied, putting her head in her hands and letting out a strained sigh.
"Not but you got them. Just make the most of it," Saph tried with a shrug.
"I know I know. Just give me a minute, alright?"
They all nodded in agreement, looking around at each other as silence reigned around the burnt-out campfire. Fengi did eventually look up, glancing around at them and pulling a slight smile, which Saph guessed was at least a bit fake.
"Quite the day, huh? You should have seen the look on Essy's face when Glira worked out who was coming."
"That was not quite who I had expected to interrupt lunch prep, I must say," Essy added, shaking her head, a smile on her face as she let out a giggle that most of them joined in on. "What's next, the king comes calling?"
"Now now. A prince at best," Saph joked as they all laughed a bit at that
"With our luck, that's exactly what will happen," Fengi sighed, turning her attention towards Yldril, who was without a doubt listening in. "What do you say, Yldril. We're in this together now, aye?"
"Since when were we not," the black dragon sneered.
"Well she could just have killed you before the inquisitor came here, but now we can't get away with that," Saph added in, turning to look at the dragon as well.
"And defy the prancy horse?"
"Kalestine… she's called Kalestine," Fengi corrected.
"What does that change? It's just a name. I have been bound to the will of a stupid little street girl playing at knowing how the world works."
"Fucking hell," Saph sighed, glaring at the dragon. "You know, maybe the people that kicked you out weren't that shit. Maybe you were just insufferable!"
"And maybe I should have had you as a snack when I could."
"Like you could ever catch me," Saph chuffed, turning to look at Fengi, who was staring angrily at her. "What?"
"Weren't you kicked out from home too?"
"Uhm… yeah," Saph replied, ears dropping a bit, looking off to the side.
"You heard the shit she's been through. Isn't that enough to at least earn her a bit of pity?" Fengi snapped, Saph catching Yldril pulling a slight smile out of the corner of her eye.
"Well I don't run around trying to kill regular people," Saph protested, throwing up her arms.
"No, and neither will she from now on. And you can wipe that smug smile off your face," Fengi carried on, turning to glare at Yldril. "Just cause your life has been shit doesn't mean you get to make it worse for everyone else. All you end up with is more stories like yours. I promised you I would not take away your ability to speak freely. And I already made good on that promise. That doesn't mean I won't punish you for being an arsehole."
"And how do you intend to do that? I can't do anything!?"
"I'll make a list for when you can," Fengi replied, staring daggers at the dragon. "You will do good to repay for not being a good person."
"That has got to be the most naive thing I have ever heard."
"And yet I can still do it."
"I am going to be worked to the bone either way. You forgot the incentive in your little plan, mayflies."
"Getting a bath, better food, brushing and polishing, days off, finishing early. I can do a lot of things to make your life easier. Isn't that what you wanted? A nice place to stay where they won't kick you out? Well I'm giving you one. So just be a little bit grateful!"
"I think she wants to lean back and relax while having her every need taken care of," Saph replied, trying not to growl as she turned back to glare at the burnt-out fire.
"Well, that part we don't need to worry about, now do we… come girls, I think she needs a bit of alone time. Since I'm not burning magic right now, I think I'm allowed to go back to the keep. Yldril, don't hurt anyone or break anything. I'll be back tomorrow when you have had a chance to think for a bit."
"I don't even get a tent over my head," Yldril protested as they all got up.
"Tough shit," Fengi replied as she walked off, receiving nothing but an annoyed grumble from the dragon. Unkai seemed a touch conflicted, looking between Fengi and Yldril.
"S-Should I stay here? In case she needs me?"
Fengi stopped in her tracks, turning around glancing between the healer and the dragon.
"... Yes, that's probably the smartest. I can only imagine how angry Joelina would be if something happened to her new oxen."
***
"I believe this will work, yes… It will need to be flattened, obviously. Is there a quarry anywhere near here?" Joelina questioned, looking over the site they had selected for the possible warehouse.
"It's old and overgrown, but the place they cut the stone for the keep is about twenty minutes that way. I believe there would still be plenty of good stones," Kuliger replied. The resident carpenter was the most knowledgeable person around when it came to construction work, from the keep at least.
"Very good. And we save the open field over there for the factory floor."
"I didn't know construction planning was part of the inquisitorial job description," Kulinger replied in a truly astoundingly kind and even interested tone.
'Even the old grump knows when it's time to behave,' Tom pondered to himself. 'Either that or these folks are religious enough to meet his standards… both could be possible.'
"It is not. But I need a factory, so a factory I shall have. How about wood. This Kalestine. How would you describe your standing with her?"
"She's a most magnificent creature. I am sure she will understand the importance behind the work being done and mark out some trees useful for the project," Kulinger replied, making no effort to hide his reverence for the unicorn.
"I see," Joelina replied, turning to look around at the other people assembled for the little surveying trip. "Any other remarks?"
"It might take some convincing to get any good trees near here," Dakota admitted. "It's already a fair flight to the forest.
"I think mentioning who would be hauling them might at least help with getting some large ones," Tom added. "More work equals more punishment and all."
"Also, do you intend to build using fresh timbers?" Kulinger asked, sounding fairly skeptical.
"We don't have time for drying it or whatever needs to be done. If you can have some ready for spring next year you can use them for the factory."
"Oh… Well it won't last then."
"Isn't Hylsdal being built with fresh too?" Tom asked, looking at Kulinger.
"They need a roof over their head. They will be fighting those beams for years unless they just take them out and replace them"
"Uhm… now I'm not an idiot, but why?"
"They will warp, shrink, and if under load crack and split and more warping obviously."
"Right…"
"But this is just a warehouse. The factory sounds more important."
"That it is," Joelina agreed. "But construction will start in spring."
"Timbers like that need years to properly cure. It will look like a crooked mess."
"Then a crooked mess it will be. Just make it work," Joelina replied, setting off at a walk towards the bunker. "You needed more of those, yes?"
"Yes, for the explosive… well anything really," Tom replied, jogging after her to catch up, feeling as much as seeing the armored woman keeping an eye on him.
"How long would it take to make one?"
"A few days to put together. More to make the beams and planks."
"I would say a week at best," Kulinger added, clearly having decided to keep up as well.
"Could it be done faster?"
"Not really if you want to keep it dry," Tom replied politely.
"Very well, let's see then," she replied as they came upon the small structure. "A hole in the ground with a roof." Joelina went to walk around it, appraising it. "I like it. Nice and simple."
"The simple solution is often the best."
"Wishful thinking, but a noble sentiment nonetheless," Joelina replied, arriving at the door. "I wish to see the inside as well."
"Of course. But it goes without saying, no touching and no fire."
"Of course."
"Right then, follow me," Tom replied courteously, going down to the door and cracking it open before pushing it up and over to let gravity hold it open. "There we go. It's a little dark but no fire inside."
"Not to worry," Joelina replied, holding up her necklace as it started to shine bright. "I come prepared for dark places. By the way, I would love to pick your brain in private a bit later if that would be possible."
"I don't believe this is a yes or no question, is it?"
"Of course not. Library after dinner. I need to know if betting this much on you even has a chance of working."

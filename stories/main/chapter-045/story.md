It had taken a few days for Dakota to get Nunuk to agree. Apuma had tried figuring out if someone was allowed to join both the guard and the huntresses. In the end, the fact that it wasn't mentioned anywhere, what the case for nondragonettes was, had closed the deal. Even if Apuma was still a little grumpy they had stopped his searching on the third day. Sapphire had gotten off her crutches and was walking about again even if she was not allowed to fly yet, instead doing various exercises with her wings to try and strengthen them again. She did still need to be careful with her leg though.

Luckily they had agreed he didn't need to do any cross-dressing. His current equipment would do. Even if they were again fussing over the lack of white. He had elected to just wear his fancy new cape for once turning it white, which seemed to satisfy them. He did still want to get that thing resown into something, but there wasn't enough fabric to make a full uniform. The cape was long enough to mostly wrap him up in so it seemed best utilized like that for the time being.

They had insisted that he needed some jewelry though as much as possible in fact. Every huntress was supposed to show off just how well their keep was doing apparently since they were often the ones out and about. So against his wishes, he had gotten out some of the few pieces he had brought for trade purposes and donned them.

This had clearly been insufficient so he had been forced into borrowing a few pieces from the other huntresses. They even made him wear a modified version of the weird tiara thing they all had in copper. Apparently, it signified his rank within the huntresses. He guessed that made him whatever was above recruit. Fengi too was wearing a copper one after all and she was clearly a fully-fledged member.

When Tom had tried to protest against the quickly growing amount of jewelry, Sapphire had just gone. "You need to be the best girl don't you? or was it most?" He had damn near smacked her for that one. As the whole room started laughing. It would seem everyone had that particular story retold in detail.

As he stood in Dakota's room getting kitted out. He felt like he was the victim of a girls night only everyone around him was armed and trained killers. Judging by the fact he was now the most blinged-out figure in the room they all found it hilarious that he found it this uncomfortable. At least they hadn't made him shave or do something with his hair. That whole situation had clearly stumped them since, well, they didn't have any.

They had tried to tie it up though, in the end, Fengi had figured out how to make two very simple ponytails. She claimed it looked a bit like their horns. When Esmeralda had asked if they had anything they could use to die it with, He had threatened to shave himself bald. He was just happy they didn't have any makeup. He elected he needed to make sure he didn't teach them about that particular invention ever.

He ended up looking like the gayest medieval reenactor he had ever seen or heard of. He honestly didn't know whether to laugh or cry as he marched out in front of Nunuk sitting in her high chair. There was a lot of cheering and hooting from everyone assembled to watch the proceedings. Especially the guard who clearly found it hilarious to watch him decked out like this. Kokashi appeared to nearly fall over laughing.

Kiran just turned to Holdey "See I told you so!"

The old lady still looked haggard, sitting in her chair. She even still had some bandages on. Tom had asked if Dakota couldn't just have done it in her place. But Nunuk had refused point-blank. She could walk so she could take his oath. The offer of doing it in the infirmary hadn't worked either so here they were.

It was supposedly going to be much the same deal as when he had been inducted into the guard when he first came here. He was to swear another oath of fealty to the Bizmati family and the keep as a whole.

He had been instructed on what to say this time. The last one had been a bit of a mess, magical translation, general confusion, and all.

"Tomas Hansen, on account of the fact your people do not align with ours on matters of gender roles or physical characteristics. You have been deemed eligible to join our huntresses. In light of recent events, my daughter has seen fit to request your immediate addition to her ranks. I have elected to grant her this request. Do you accept the responsibility of joining our Huntresses under my daughter's command?"

"I do my Lady." Tom felt more like he was at a wedding and he was the fucking bride. Nunuk's breathing was heavy and she was clearly in pain even from speaking. Better to just get this over with.

"Very well, I will have you recite the oath of the huntress then." Nunuk stood the effort clearly painful as she winced. Why couldn't she just have stayed in bed? As she began, placing her hand on her chest. Tom doing the same echoing back the sentences one by one.

"Repeat after me.

I solemnly swear, to show the good virtue of this keep and the name of Bizmati.

I shall provide for my keep and hunt far and wide for it and those who call it home.

I shall take to the wing by the will of my Lord or Lady and always hunt the prey that they require of me.

I shall not seek to keep my spoils from those who I have sworn to serve. For such would be my undoing."

They really hadn't been that creative with these, Tom thought. That was pretty much the same one as last time. Still, he was apparently now sworn to defend the keep and go to war for it if he understood this correctly. If an enemy could be classified as prey at least. Also keeping the spoils of his work was apparently his undoing. Were they communists or something?

Following the swearing of the oath, there had been a short celebration, mostly just people congratulating Tom. He guessed this would normally be a big day for someone. Looking at the other huntresses he did feel like he had cheated or something. But they were the ones who had asked him so not much to do about it. Besides they were all clearly finding it hilarious so he could play along.

***

Right then, that had neatly solved the problem of bringing Tom on a hunt. Even if Sapphire could see Fengi was putting a false smile on for the inauguration. Maybe she was just tired though, the last few days had been multiple trips a day after all.

She had worked for years to become good enough to get her crown. Tom just had it handed to him. Tom was a lot older than Fengi though and Sapphire herself had been accepted after just a short year as a trainee. It wasn't like Sapphire didn't feel Tom deserved it and he was certainly deadly enough to warrant it, but still, it did take the air out of the celebrations, that this wasn't really a big day like it usually was.

Luckily Tom didn't seem to mind they weren't holding a feast in his honor like they usually did. In fact, he looked like he was ready to be done with it the moment he walked out into the hall. He had protested loudly at the fact they had decked him out in as much jewelry as they could get their hands on. It was a shame his ears weren't really made for earrings.

They were so soft and floppy, and he couldn't move them more than a little wiggle. He had protested loudly at the notion of poking holes in them too, so maybe they were very sensitive. The hair had been a challenge, he had a combe to straighten it all out from the usual mess. He clearly considered this sufficient and they had no clue what you could do with hair like this. Fengi sort of fixed the problem with some string making two long strands which looked a bit like floppy horns if you squinted very hard. Esmeralda had a bit of fine silver chain they tied into the hair. It looked weird but it would have to do.

In Sapphire's opinion, it was still the best Tom had ever looked. The armbands and necklace were a fine addition and rings hadn't been a problem. His crown wasn't bad either, Shiva having hastily modified one to fit his head. He was starting out as a copper obviously which technically made Sapphire his superior. She would make sure to rub his face in that one at some point.

Following the swearing-in and short celebrations, she had gone up to Dakota to discuss just how uncomfortable Tom clearly was at the whole situation and suggested a plan. A fiendish smile was all the reply she needed from Dakota. This should be fun.

Dakota had gotten up onto a chair to get everyone's attention.

"Seeing as we have a new huntress or perhaps I should say hunter among us, I would like to know just what I have been given to work with. We shall depart immediately. Sapphire, you ride with our newest addition. We make for the plains"

It had taken a second for Tom to realize just what that meant as he looked down at all the jewelry he was carrying and shook his head despairingly.

Tom had gotten his weapons including the fourth gun he had been talking about. Following the discovery he had brought another one, there had been rumors running rampant in the keep. Mostly people discussing if they could manage to get it off him somehow and what their plan for doing so was.

Sapphire for her part was playing on it being her to receive the privilege, she did think of herself as Tom's closest friend with exception of Kiran of course. It looked different from his rifle, it was just as long if not a bit longer. Looking at the end of what he called the barrel for whatever reason. It had a much larger hole, was this even more powerful than his rifle? If so why hadn't he used it and what would happen if he fired it. She had heard Jackalope and Esmeralda's tales of how his revolver had felt like they were kicked in the hand.

Jackalope had of course not been ready for it resulting in the face smack. It would make sense if a more powerful gun kicked harder. So what would this do then? On second thought, perhaps Jackalope could be allowed to test fire it first just to be sure.

They had mounted up, on the quad bike, Sapphire sitting behind him. He had insisted on bringing the trailer and a few other items, she guessed he was planning on doing a lot of hunting today. Perhaps to make a good first impression.

They had traveled fast by ground standards, but the others still had to wait for them a bit every now and again. Jackalope had come along too despite not being able to fire her bow. She was not going to miss Tom's first hunt, she made that clear.

On the way, Sapphire had finally given in to her curiosity.

"Tom, what is this other gun you brought? It looks a lot different" Tom had slowed down a bit so they could talk more easily.

"It's a shotgun, It fires many little round balls in at once. Great for birds and small things"

"So it's not just a bigger one, also why does it have two barrels? The other ones only have one."

"No, the rifle is actually more deadly at least at range. A shotgun is only really effective to maybe 30 meters, but that is pushing it. As for two barrels it has two shots. Then you have to reload yourself."

"I see so it's like for some who can't hit anything?"

"More like things which are hard to hit but sure, whichever way you look at it."

"But why not make it like your rifle so it has many shots?"

"Well back home you are only allowed to have two shots, remember hunting is a hobby mostly"

"So you deliberately made your weapons worse to make the hunt more challenging?"

"Yep."

"You're crazy, but why would you bring a weapon here which isn't as good as you can make it?"

"It was the one I had. Besides, there are a lot of weapons out there that are better than mine. I'm just not allowed to have them. They are for the army only."

"Wait, your weapons aren't used by the army? What do they have then and you said you were in the army"

"I was army once. Not anymore." Tom appeared to think over his response for a bit before answering

"They use rifles which fire faster. You have seen when I shoot I have to load the next round, yes?"

"Yeah you move the lever thing back and forth and it spits out the metal cylinder"

"Army guns do that themselves, they fire as long as you hold down the trigger. Bang, bang bang. A machine gun can fire hundreds of rounds in seconds before reloading. Assault rifle usually 30"

"I see." She had just replied. She needed a bit of quiet time for that one again. He had talked about weapons that could destroy cities, so of course, they had this kind of thing. It had just been so abstract. A weapon that fired itself with the power of Tom's rifle. She could understand why they felt the need to hide if that was a normal weapon to them. The amount of death that could cause.

Jackalope had come down alongside, perhaps wondering why they had slowed down.

"Has it gotten tired or something?" Tom responded by speeding back up again. It wasn't much further to the tree line. As they crested a ridge they could see a herd of large red deer in the far off distance not far from the edge of the forest. They didn't hunt red deer that often as it was a lot of work to get them home. sometimes they would herd them back home to make the trip shorter.

Tom had warned them that his quad bike used fuel which he could not yet replace even if he had brought quite a bit of it. He had still wanted to go near the woods though for some reason so this seemed like as good of a target as any. Tom pulled to a stop getting out the binoculars seemingly agreeing with her.

The others had come down seeing as they had stopped. Dakota walking up to them arms crossed

"So then Tom, I'm guessing you have found a target, how do you wanna do this?" Dakota had questioned

"Aren't you the leader?" Tom replied, seeming a bit confused.

"This is your first hunt as a true huntress, you are in charge today." Sapphire knew that was a blatant lie, but hey, it was a good excuse. Fengi had raised her hand for a moment as if to ask a question before Esmeralda lowered it back down. Tom didn't seem to notice though.

"Well back home I need to sneak up on them on foot. I have not tested my rifle beyond 250 meters so that is max. I would like to get closer though.

"You want to slowly walk up to them and hope they don't run away?"

"Not much else to do, can't outrun them and can't fly" Tom gestured to Dakota. "I have a gun and some grass to hide in" Tom looked down at some of the jewelry and walked about a bit, he nearly rattled as he walked. All except Dakota had a bit of a snicker.

"Okay then, anything you want us to do, except watch?" Dakota asked, still sounding serious. Sapphire admired her for keeping a straight face, she was certainly struggling. He was so keen on hiding for his first hunt and they had covered him in polished metal.

Tom seemed to have a brain wave at that though, his face lighting up as he thought for a second.

"Can you herd them?"

***

Okay then, there he was in the middle of a grassy meadow a bunch of red deer a little over a kilometer away, apparently not bothered by the fact they were here. Also, he was now in charge of this hunt for some reason. His first idea had been sneaking up on the herd and picking one off at long range. The deer here likely had never been hunted from the ground, at least at this kind of range and never with a rifle. So he was confident it should be an easy hunt. All the bling might be a bit of a problem though.

That idea clearly hadn't gotten much traction though. Damn these expectations. That is when Tom had realized he was not alone here now was he. He was in charge, so he had a squad of airborne and mostly combat-able dragonettes at his disposal.

He began explaining the concept of ambush hunting. They clearly knew how to herd a flock of animals, they claimed to use it to keep them in the open and sometimes herd them closer to home. The whole lying and waiting thing was not something they had tried though. It took some convincing, but they had put him in charge after all so ambush it was.

He and Sapphire would lie in wait. Sapphire with the new bow and him with his rifle. While the others would herd the deer towards them picking up any targets of opportunity. It was a large herd, they could take quite a few animals without hurting it too badly and they needed a large haul after all. So might as well go for broke.

Dakota had decided to stand off to watch from the sky not feeling up for joining in the herding yet and she was curious just how this would work. Jackalope, Fengi, and Esmeralda would be doing the herding then. Jackalope might be down a hand but there was nothing wrong with her wings.

The group had retreated to behind the hilltop and the dragonettes took to the sky climbing away from the herd so as not to spook them. They then circled high around the herd coming at them from the forest, just cresting the treetops. Tom was crouching on the top of the ridge with his binoculars. Keeping an eye on the herd.

The sight of the huntresses descending down, shouting and roaring had the desired effect. As one, the herd turned to run away from the threat. Tom was gonna have to trust the huntresses to keep them together and going in the right direction as he ran back down to Sapphire. It wasn't like he could do anything except wait after all.

They both crouched down sitting at the ready, Sapphire having an arrow knocked. The wait was excruciating. It had been a while since Tom had been hunting, he liked hunting. This was fairly different from the quiet stalking procedure he was used to though. It was a bit like having dogs and handlers pushing through a section of forest driving animals towards them. Except this was a big herd of stampeding red deer.

As he held his breath he could hear the dragonettes making as much noise as possible just like he had told them to. The herd came up over the top about at the same time as he got a Lion King flashback. Perhaps this hadn't been the best idea. He got to his feet taking aim at the lead animal. Back home this would be considered reckless or perhaps downright idiotic. Not to mention poor sportsmanship, but this was a matter of food not sport. He just hoped that they would veer off and not just plow right through them.

Sapphire fired first letting an arrow fly hitting the lead animal in the throat dropping it rolling to the ground. Tom followed up with a shot to another one square in the chest. The large deer panicked splitting up to either side of them, some stopping to go back over the ridge. The results were perfect flanking shots galore. He did beat her to the follow-up shot putting down another deer with a fine shot to the shoulder blade. It had stopped for a moment turning to go back the way it came.

Sapphire landed a shot on a large buck. The shot was perfect once again right in the neck. Tom was beginning to suspect she was some sort of magician with a bow. She had only had the thing for a few days after all. For his part, he bodged the third shot, as the deer began coming around the two of them. Blowing off a leg with a low shot. They were splitting up nicely and they each turned to go back to back. He heard Sapphire loose another arrow behind him as he was forced to put another one into the one he wounded. He didn't want it getting away missing a leg after all that would just be too cruel.

As the herd opened the distance on them he loved his rifle. That was 6 deer by his count, they needed time to process the meat after all. No use killing more than they needed not to mention what they could carry. He turned to Sapphire as she loosed another arrow hitting a bounding deer in the back of the head. He swore he could see the arrow turn before it hit the target. That was an insane shot the deer bounding from side to side at more than 50 meters. With a damn bow!

"There, I win"

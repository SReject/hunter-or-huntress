Things had been coming together rather nicely in preparation for the little festival, it had been a rather early morning for Tom since there was quite a lot to do, but still, today was gonna be a good day. The weather was nice, if a little windy, just like Raulf had promised, even if the ground was still a bit wet from the last few days. Jarix was (somewhat against his will) being decorated by the kids. Red tail paint included. At this rate, Tom would need to make red paint a regular shopping priority. Fires for the spit roasts that would make up the bulk of the meal were well underway, and the kitchen was busy with whatever side dishes they had been able to come up with.
They had quite a few surprises in store for the day, like corn on the cob for the starters. Tom didn't consider that much of a starter, but it was sweet and with some salt and butter it should be quite the hit. For dessert they had gone with rather crude layer cakes, made with berries, whipped cream, and, of course, the marvel of sugar. That had been Tom's little personal project for the day, Essy and Dakota being recruited to help out since, well, they were probably the least likely to eat it all before time. Not to mention their superior skills when it came to keeping kids out of the kitchens, which would doubtlessly be very handy.
The lack of a fridge to keep the cakes fresh till evening had proven problematic, but just a touch of frost powder added to a bucket of water in the big chest Tom had brought so many of his things in had done the trick. The sugar was brown sugar and was not that uniform in texture, but it was definitely sweet, so it would do the job. Tom was just glad the two women had taken on the duty of whipping the cream. It wasn't that he was lazy. It was just hard work… and he was busy right now. It was time to get the baked bits out of the tin after they had been allowed to rest a bit.
"Tom, is it strange I've seen you concentrating less when working with explosives?" Dakota questioned, with a bit of a smile.
"I'm used to that. I haven't baked a cake since...  since..."
"You don't know, do you?" Essy chuckled. "Well don't be shy, it's only the first cake made with sugar anyone around here has ever tasted."
"... Wonderful weather today isn't it?" Tom went, looking out the window.
"Enjoy it while it lasts, it will be raining tomorrow," Raulf added from over by the oven as he got a few loaves of bread ready for when Tom was done.
"We will. Also, don't change the subject," Dakota replied with a level of sass that was honestly rare for her. Maybe she had finally embraced the Saph and Jacky approach of just going with it… Either that, or she enjoyed the fact that he sucked at baking.
'Operation smiles, hell yeah,' Tom mused to himself. He didn't care that it was a stupid name. It was accurate, so it was perfect.
"As long as it doesn't rain on the cakes. He's gonna be absolutely devastated," Essy clucked as she tapped her foot, humming some kind of tune.
"Yeah, that will be what finally makes me snap. My cakes got ruined."
"How do you think we will feel? There will be tears in the children's bedroom, that's for sure," Essy retorted, head starting to bob as she apparently got to the good part even as she was working away on the cream.
"You haven't told them, have you?" Tom questioned, looking to the huntress.
"Hell no, it's a surprise after all," Essy replied with mirth in her voice, even if she was sounding a touch strained from whipping the cream. Looking to Dakota, she continued, "Your turn."
"And an expensive one at that," Dakota added, though still smiling, it didn't seem forced either.
"God, we should try and make some hard candy too. I wonder if we can make them like little gold bars, with purity rates and everything. I can already imagine the stories of when the school trip got into the bank vault and ate the national reserves."
"Only if it was a clutch of young dragons, otherwise I think it would end in tragedy," Essy added with a sigh as she leaned against the counter.
"Oh, that's a mental picture right there. A school teacher trying to keep 15 tiny dragons in line," Tom chuckled as he set about removing the cakes from the tins.
"I rate the teacher's life expectancy at around 12 minutes," Dakota replied with a laugh. "Ready for the cream?"
"Ready when you are. Essy, bring the berries, will you?"
"Ready to decorate. Want some sugar too?"
"Why not? Go nuts," Tom replied as they started up the process of assembling all the cakes and putting the finished product into the cooling box. "Do they actually have dragon daycare?" Tom questioned after they got into the groove with the work.
"Well sure, I remember seeing a day trip once in Bartelion. It was only four dragons with over ten carers. It was quite the sight."
"Do they, like, spill acid on the floor when they sneeze?"
"... I didn't think of that if I'm totally honest with you," Dakota replied with a thoughtful look.
"They had both a red, green, and a blue… How do you even proof against that?" Essy questioned as she expertly covered the side of a cake with whipped cream.
"Really good insurance?" Tom replied with a shrug.
"... We should get insurance on the keep," Dakota went, looking as if a lightbulb should be hanging above her head.
"No, cake first, paperwork later," Essy went, pushing Dakota's head back down towards the work at hand.
"Man skal yde før man kan nyde," Tom went as he got started on the next cake. The two women just looked at him, clearly expecting an explanation.
"You must earn the enjoyment. Work then fun. That kind of saying," he went with a shrug.
"Well, this is certainly hard work," Essy went with a giggle as she plonked down the berries in a pleasing pattern, lining the edge with crushed sugar. She paused after a little, the smile fading from her face. "If only Ana had been here to see this…"
Dakota dropped what she was doing and went over to give Essy a hug. "Come now, we've been over this. It wasn't your fault."
"We were so close. She could have gotten to see all this. She'd never even seen a cake before," Essy went, beginning to sob into Dakota's arms. Tom gave a mortified look to Raulf, who seemed equally uncertain of just what to do, gesturing for Tom to just do something.
Tom went over and joined in the now group hug, just keeping quiet for now.
"She's in a better place now, no need to worry about all the horrible things down here. She's free, forever."
"Do you think they have music in heaven? What about cake, or movies?" Essy went as she grabbed Dakota, clutching her tight.
"I'm sure she's watching all the movies right now, doing whatever she wants and waiting for us all to come join her."
"Where I'm from I think heaven is supposed to be everything you have ever dreamt of. She'll be as happy as she can even imagine," Tom added, hugging Essy from behind, wrapping his arms around Dakota's back. "As happy as only a child can be."
"Sounds nice," Essy relented as she continued to sob for a while longer, eventually calming down.
"Not everyone makes it around these lands. We have been so lucky yet so unlucky the last half year," Dakota went, patting Essy on the shoulder.
"I know… but look at it all. She wouldn't have believed her eyes," Essy replied, gesturing around the room.
"With a little luck, if there is a next time, they won't even get to lay a finger on those inside the walls," Tom added, looking at the ground in shame. Essy let go and straightened up again, sniffing a few times and wiping her eyes.
"You don't get to look like that. Remember what you did that day. You kicked the crap out of them," Dakota went, forcefully raising Tom's face with a single strong finger.
"Well, it wasn't enough, now was it? Next time it damn well will be. They will all get to live, and to be happy."
Then it was Tom's turn to receive a hug from the now mostly recovered Essy. "Thank you. Thank you for everything you have done. For us. For the kids."
"Sounds like we can throw the world in there too soon," Dakota added, looking at Tom with a contented smile.
"Thank you," Tom replied. "finally found it."
"Found what?" Dakota questioned, still smiling as she tilted her head.
"A home. A place worth fighting for."

Saph was pretty pleased with herself for securing the title of games master for the night. It sure beats cooking, even if she was probably missing out on a few samples of sweet goodness. All she had to do was bring out what outdoor games they had and, at her own request, set up the courses around the keep, using a few odd flags. They had never been able to have a leaderboard before, but Tom's watch had a stopwatch in it. Even if the actual clock apparently wasn't quite lining up with the days around here, a stopwatch was still a stopwatch.
It didn't hurt that the watch looked damn good on her arm, even if it was just borrowed for the day. Once the courses were all set up, it didn't take long for Saph to start trying them out. She needed to know it was safe, of course. She had made two courses, one where everyone could take part and the advanced one. She had even managed to make a crude approximation of a climb test, going up the side of the keep with chalk marks all the way up. That had been quite the rock climb. Fengi and Unkai had stuck their heads out a window to ask what she was doing.
Her explanation of how this was a time-honored and probably somehow sacred tradition of their culture was slightly ruined by Herron claiming he had won by sticking his ass over the side of the guard tower and slapping the top marker with his tail.
"Oh will you fuck off," Saph let out, much to Herron and Fengi's amusement, Unkai following in the laughing as soon as Fengi got going.
"I am the champion of this world!" Herron let out, trying to sing the odd song Tom had translated for them following his victory at cards after dinner a few days ago.
"You aren't even the champion of sleeping. Jacky still has you beat on that when it's time for work."
"Oi, I'm not lazy!" It came from another window somewhere. "It's hard work making guns and then hunting without them."
"Oh shut it. You are the one who gets to sleep with a hot-stone every night," Saph shouted back at her.
"Yeah, but he gets up like really fucking early," Jacky went, sticking her head out a window further down.
"I don't think that's why you are tired most of the time," someone Saph didn't recognize let out.
"We know it's you Essy!" Fengi shouted out, looking around trying to figure out where that had come from. "Are the cakes done yet?"
"I wonder how long she can hang onto the wall," Unkai went thoughtfully, looking to Saph, who was seriously considering if this was worth it.
"Longer than Jacky in bed," Saph replied, climbing up a few more stones to put down the next mark.
"Why am I always the target these days!" Jacky protested loudly from her window.
"Nunuk is gonna be so pissed if that doesn't wash off," Fengi went with a giggle, ignoring Jacky's pleas.
"It's just chalk for fuck's sake," Saph replied with a groan as she climbed up higher. "And I swear if any of you wash it off, I will ram Shiva's favorite hammer up your ass and tell her you did it yourself."
"Mum, Saph wants to steal the old brass jeweler's hammer and smear shit on it," Jacky shouted back inside the room she was peeking out of.
"SHE WHAT?!" came from Jacky's window as Saph hurriedly made the last few marks, then dropped off the ledge, deciding it was time for a quick leisurely flight.
"She's lying!" Saph shouted out as she made for open-air, pondering just when it would be safe to go back indoors.
If everything had gone according to plan, then the people from Hylsdahl would be heading out early that morning, which would mean they were gonna be there early afternoon, with Tiguan speeding them up a little.
First to arrive had been Baron along with Victoria, his crew, and the keep dwellers that had been working down below. Glira had agreed to take first watch at the vaults, then Baron would relieve her later, so they both got a chance to enjoy some of the festivities without leaving the academics either undefended or unsupervised.
Baron had taken nearly a full minute to figure out what to make of Jarix post decoration, the young dragon starting to look a touch uncomfortable as the war vet stared at him. It was honestly painful to watch Jarix flatten his ears, slowly lowering his head, before the old drake broke out laughing loud enough to make Saph's feet tingle.
"You look fit for a parade. Only fitting in my opinion," the war vet finally let out when he caught his breath again. He gave Jarix an almost fatherly slap on the shoulder, which sent the young blue off balance for a second. Cries of alarm emanated from his back as some of the kids struggled to hold on.
Well, at least Jarix perked back up at that, joining in the laughter after a quick check to see if he had lost anyone.
"And to think you didn't believe I would ever make it as a soldier. My crew outnumbers yours now, I think."
"Put some effort into them and you might owe your life to them… Even if it will likely take a decade...or two.," Baron replied, looking down at Kiran and Holdey, who were already undertaking repairs to some of the decorations. The old dragon's expression growing a touch strained. "And for the record, I always believed you would. I was simply unsure you would survive the trip. Is that not correct, Colonel Hashaw?"
"That it is. Now I believe it's just a matter of waiting for the people from Deriva and Grevi. Everyone! Dismissed!" Victoria shouted out, looking serious for a split second before relaxing back into a leisurely pose, smiling as she looked around at Baron's crew scampering off in whichever direction they fancied.
Tom had seemingly managed to escape kitchen duty for a while to go greet their guests, Jacky trying to explain all the games that had been brought out at the same time. Saph had a quick look around, trying to see if she could spot Maiko anywhere as the various Royal Guard members came over to mingle around the tables that he should have helped set up.
"Looking for anyone in particular?" a familiar voice asked from next to her as she was making her way down a row of benches and chairs that had been dragged out.
"This slightly short bloke, quite skinny too, have you seen him?" Saph questioned, ignoring Maiko walking alongside her pretending to also be scanning for this elusive corporal.
"I could have sworn I saw him just a minute ago. I heard he's supposed to be a great guy. Good looking too apparently, at least in his mind."
"No, that can't be him. I'm looking for a really sly little piece of work. You know, the kind that sneaks up on you in a crowd and steals your purse."
"I also heard he is an absolute menace in battle, not that he can match that incredible woman he's walking with."
"Few can," Saph replied, laying an arm over his shoulder, pulling a smile against her will. "So, what game shall the game master destroy you at first?"
"Dueling?" Maiko questioned with a shrug and a smile as Saph's ears flattened, her expression turning distinctly unimpressed.
"I believe that's Rachuck's department…" Saph replied before livening back up, getting an excellent idea. "I guess it's time for you to fight a little for me then. I've always wanted to see Rachuck beaten at his own game by someone other than Nunuk. and that tradition is about as old as they get."
"Uhhh, Okay?" Maiko replied, sounding rather less confident now. "So like, is he really good or just quite good?"
"You'll see."
"Hurray," Maiko let out, not sounding very enthusiastic as he was led over to the training field and specifically the sparring ring.
Rachuck had been in the middle of explaining the rules for the day, the points system, and how the leaderboards would work.
Tom and Jacky had also made their way over. Well Jacky had at least; Tom seemed to be mostly in tow right now. It hadn't taken too long before the boasting had begun around the railing, quite a few of the Royal Guard wanting a go at Tom, or just wanting to see him fight. It had taken quite a bit of work by Rachuck to convince them Tom really wasn't much of a duelist.
"Look, I have seen ten-year-olds with more sword skill, and we aren't wasting expensive ammunition on another firearms demonstration," Saph eventually shouted out with a bit of a snicker as she poked Maiko with her elbow, the corporal just shaking his head and smiling too.
Tom didn't look entirely happy with that description, even if it was probably accurate. Still, it had the desired effect, as the focus quickly turned to who would hold the title of best duelist here today.
"Hey Rachuck, think you can go easy on this one?" Saph shouted out again, pushing a rather nervous-looking Maiko into the ring. "Try not to make a fool of yourself," she added in a regular tone. The corporal quickly regained his composure as he strutted up to Rachuck, shrugging as he looked over the keep's captain.
"She seems to think you are pretty good. Wanna test that theory?" the corporal opened, locking eyes with the rather nonplussed Rachuck.
Rachuck looked to Saph for a second with a hint of a sigh. "Fine. I guess we have to get this party started somehow. Got a magic sword, or should I bring a lesser weapon?"
"One day maybe. Shouldn't we be using dulled blades," Maiko questioned with a head tilt.
"Regular blade, got it," Rachuck replied, unbuckling his very ornate-looking scabbard and walking over to the railing, handing it to Anchor. Walking over to a box, he retrieved two training blades that had clearly been placed there for exactly this purpose.
'Someone is having fun I see,' Saph mused, looking at the usually very careful Rachuck, almost wishing Maiko had called him on his bluff as he came walking back over to her.
"Hold this, would you?" Maiko went, handing her his own blade.
"He's cautious and great on the defensive, and he doesn't like fighting dirty," Saph went into Maiko's ear as she took the blade, giving his snout a gentle nudge. "Go fuck him up."
The two fighters walked out into the ring and circled each other, still posturing. 'Careful now, Rachuck, not like you to feel overconfident,' Saph mused to herself.
Predictably, Maiko struck first, moving forwards quickly and kicking up sand as he probed Rachuck's defences with a stab. The experienced Rachuck easily parried, trying to exploit Maiko's position to no avail as the Corporal was already retreating after having made his probe. After a brief pause, they were back at it, blades flashing in a battle of footwork as Maiko tried to beat Rachuhck's defenses, the captain taking a few opportunities to counter-attack when Maiko became too reckless.
'No, you idiot, that's exactly what he wants,' Saph cursed to herself as the crowd started cheering for their respective favorites. "Come on, kick his ass!" Saph shouted at the corporal, being drowned out by the crowd.
It was almost depressing to watch as Maiko kept trying to gain the upper hand and wearing himself out until Rachuck finally decided enough was enough and went on the offensive himself. It didn't take more than a second or two before Maiko was backpedaling fast, Rachuck managing to step the corporal's foot and send him over backwards. Moving in for the kill, all the captain got was a face full of sand as Maiko continued the roll, flinging sand at Rachucks face with his tail.
Maiko didn't bother standing back up, instead stopping on all fours and launching himself at Rachucks legs, knocking them clean out from under the captain, who was still trying to clear his eyes as he tumbled to the ground. He regained his composure only just in time to block the blade being brought down against his neck. Maiko seemed to believe this meant he had won as he stood looking down at Rachuck with a cocky smile.
'Oh you idiot,' Saph cursed as she shook her head, knowing full well what going dirty would entail.
The kick to the crotch sent Maiko airborne by at least a few centimeters as the cocky expression faded, Saph hearing Tom groan audibly clutching his own crotch. The keep dwellers cheered as Rachuck got back to his feet, even being joined by a few from the Royal guard, notably Baron's crew.
"Not fair," Maiko let out as he walked it off, looking a little sore.
"You're one to talk," Rachuck replied, switching his grip to hold the blade with one gauntleted hand.
"Really?" Maiko replied, straightening his back before flowing back into a fighting stance.
He didn't get an answer as Rachuck charged, getting in close enough that Saph wondered if he was going for a bite. Within a second Maiko's blade had been trapped and wrested from his grip.
"Got any more tricks?" Rachuck shouted out loud enough for everyone to hear.
"I could spit at you," Maiko replied with a laugh, holding up his hands admitting defeat. "No hard feelings?"
Rachuck just stared at the corporal, looking rather unimpressed before giving Maiko a bonk on the helmet with the flat side of his sword and smiling himself. "Saph did warn me you don't play by the rules," he replied, turning away and walking back over to Saph, who found herself surrounded by most of Baron's crew.
"Dead people don't care about cheating."
"No one's dying today. Next two," Rachuck went gesturing at the ring.
"I want a crack at the big guy," one of the swordswomen from Baron's crew went, vaulting over the railing and pointing at Anchor.
"Don't get your hopes up, Liz. He's taken, I think," Maiko went as he walked up next to Rachuck, his cocky smile turning nervous as he looked at Saph.
"Ha ha, a great comedian you definitely ain't," Liz shot back.
"Doesn't help when someone has the humor of a hundred-year-old librarian," the corporal replied, throwing a glance at Liz as she was apparently called.
"Right, I'm kicking your ass instead. Come on."
Maiko turned back to look at Saph, who just lifted her hands as she leaned on the railing.
"Fine, I'll go another round."
"Keep going soldier, might beat a civilian one day," Rachuck added as he handed the training sword off to Liz.
***
It had taken a few rounds of fighting before Grevi had been spotted on the horizon just as Victoria was treating them to a right beat down, kicking the ever-loving shit out of Liz after the swordswoman got a little too big for her boots… Assuming she had any. Tom needed a new metaphor for that… Too fat for her wings? Doesn't matter, Grevi was incoming, and he needed to say hi. He hadn't done much talking with the green, and it was still a damn dragon after all. Even if he was still a little scared her breath would kill him by accident.
It wouldn't do for him to lecture them about Tiguan only to be scared of Grevi himself though. When the green had come down, the crew had disembarked in short order, all of them standing at attention for Victoria real quick before being let off the hook. Tom didn't have too long before he needed to be back in the kitchen. Dakota had demanded it after how much of a song and dance he had put on about the brown sauce that would be absolutely essential for making the main course something to remember.
"So what are you three killing machines up to?" Tom questioned, starting to pull up a chair for a little chatting session. He quickly abandoned the seating project to catch Kiran as he half fell down from Jarix back with a cry of "Yay Tom!"
"I guess just passing the time, for now. Everyone needs to let off a little steam," Baron went, looking to his crew getting started on some of the various games. They watched as Sergeant Kolinky went over to the little stall Turinia had set up with the help of her mother, where she was selling the closest they had been able to make to lemonade using some sugar and berries.
Judging by the look on Kolinki's face, he was not expecting a five-year-old businesswoman, but Turinia knew what the sweet drink cost. She was clearly not giving in to bartering either, much to Tom's amusement.
"Not a bad arrangement considering the situation."
"I don't think it's half bad, full stop," Tom countered.
"For a frontier keep I would say this is very good, no?" Grevi added, looking to Baron for confirmation, the old red nodding sagely.
"It damn better be, we worked our asses off for it," Jarix went, looking to Tom with a smile. "I can't wait to have a slice of cake."
"That's not gonna be the only treat today. Just try not to cost us all the money. It is still expensive stuff."
"I know I know. But come on, you literally dug it out of the ground," Grevi countered, looking rather excited.
"Yeah, which is not as easy as it sounds," Jarix went, looking a little proud. "It is hard work."
"Oh come on, anyone can dig a hole."
"Well you are welcome to help out moving forwards," Tom went with a chuckle. "Don't worry, it does come with a bath."
"I am a war drake. I do battle, not gardening."
"Yeah, her parents are the ones with green fingers." Jarix went with a cocky smile.
"Oh, like they are actually farmers?" Tom questioned, intrigued.
"They own an apple orchard, on the northern outskirts of the Capital," Grevi retorted with dignity, holding her head high.
"Interesting…" Tom replied, thinking that one over… Apuma had mentioned greens tended to be more amenable to working with greenery, ironically enough, considering what came out of their mouths... Then again, pretty much everything that came out of a dragon's maw was bad for your health to an extreme degree.
"They toil away for meager reward," Grevi continued, shaking her head and rolling her eyes, her inner teenager finally showing like it had in Jarix and Tiguan.
'Hah there it is,' Tom went to himself as he just shrugged. "Well, the best soldiers tend to be those who work the most. Laying around doesn't do much for fighting prowess."
"Are you questioning my skill in battle?" the green questioned, straight back into the cool professionalism he had come to expect from Baron.
"Hell no," Tom went with a not at all nervous chuckle. "But I do think Jarix has gotten stronger over the last few months." Well, that certainly seemed to make Jarix sit a little bit taller. Much to Tom's amusement, and to his relief, it also seemed to grab Grevi's attention.
"Jarix the interceptor growing stronger?" she questioned with a deadpan look, though she was clearly inspecting Jarix to see if she could tell a difference.
"They do have a rope that should be strong enough," Baron went with a scheming smile, looking at the two dragons measuring each other up.
"Yeah, we took four lengths of the rope we used for plowing and bound it together. Wrapped the ends in leather scraps. Should be good for it," Raulf added, excited they might get to test out his creation.
"Winner gets to try against Tiguan," Grevi said, Jarix taking a second to consider before nodding with a grin.
"Oh this is gonna be awesome," Tom let out from his chair, considering just how long it would take before he would get shouted at for leaving the kitchen. 'Nah, everyone is coming over to watch anyway,' Tom chuckled to himself, seeing how people were all crowding around.
That included Jacky, who decided the fact he had a chair was a perfect excuse for sitting down crossways on his lap.
"So, this seems interesting," she went, giving him a quick nuzzle.
"It's gonna be awesome," Tom replied, kissing her on the neck. "I wonder how many of us it would take to beat one of them."
That seemed to stump Jacky for a bit as she set to work counting on her fingers. 'More than we have Jacky… more than we have,' Tom chuckled to himself, shaking his head and giving her a squeeze.
"Don't break the rope," Victoria let out, leaning against Baron's side. "You wanna go at it, old sport?"
"Against who? Also, you are sounding like your father, you know that, yes?"
"Oh come on, I'm not that bad."
"Do we need to go get the harness?" Fengi questioned, looking between the two dragons. "Wait no, we only have one."
"You're not afraid to pull out a tooth, are you?" Jarix questioned with a grin, baring his teeth.
"No," Grevi replied, picking up the rope in her mouth and taking a ready stance.
Jarix was a bit less dignified squaring up in front of Grevi, picking up the rope and shifting his weight from side to side, looking like an excited dog.
"Hey, Games master!" Tom shouted out, Saph making her way out of the crowd and digging up a line in the grass with her foot at the center of the rope.
"First over the line losses," she shouted out, retreating a bit. "Ready, Set, GO!"

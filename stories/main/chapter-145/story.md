"We are moving!" Jacky shouted at him. Tom had just about registered the need to get back when she had yanked him off his feet and bolted with him over her shoulder. Looking back, he saw Saph desperately pulling on Fengi, her feet digging in deep. Esmeralda was rushing to her aid, Rachuck putting himself between them and Yldril, shield raised for all the good that would do.

Glira fought to keep the screaming Yldril down, which was clearly easier said than done. The black dragon had broken just about every brace they had put on her. Her tail thrashed around wild until a deafening crack snapped the end off to Tom's astonishment.

'The fuck is going on?' he asked himself as Jacky put some distance between them and Yldril. The screaming was high-pitched and unnatural, like nails on a blackboard mixed with the howling of a wounded dog. Tom already had a mean migraine, though it felt like it wasn't just the screams causing it. It was a familiar pain, like the headache that damn unicorn had given him back at their first meeting.

Then as abruptly as it had started, the light faded from Fengi and she fell into Saph and Essy's arms, Yldril too going limp under Glira's weight. The scream turned into a whimper, then mewling as Tom tapped on Jacky's back. "Slow down. I think- I think that's it."

"You sure?" Jacky asked as she slowed down, turning to look for herself. "Like completely sure?"

"I have no fucking clue," Tom admitted as she put him down, though she didn't let go as she moved behind him instead.

"What the fuck was that!" Tom asked Linkosta, who was already walking back towards the dragon, having bolted too. "Was that fucking Kalestine?!"

"I-I I think so," the mage stuttered, seeming utterly dumbstruck as she stared at Saph and Fengi. "How is that possible?"

"Blessed be her holiness, I guess," Jacky added as Tom cautiously started walking back up towards Fengi.

Saph and Essy had started carrying her to a safe distance, Jinora still clutching Fengi's chest. 'I swear to god, gods or whatever, if that pope horse hurt the kid doing this,' Tom caught himself thinking as he quickened his pace.

After a bit of resistance Jacky let him, following close behind. Walking up, Fengi was already stirring, Jinora crying her heart out as Saph pried the kid off of Fengi and tried to console her as best she could.

"Is she breathing?" Rachuck had asked, not having left his shielding position.

"She's still with us. How are you feeling, Fengi?" Essy asked as she held the young woman's head.

"Pretty rough, not gonna lie… I think I just… I might like carrots now," Fengi replied, staring up at the sky with a serene expression on her face.

"What's a carrot?"

"I don't know," Fengi replied, seeming totally serious.

"A vegetable. It's like an orange stick?" Tom added, raising an eyebrow.

"Have you got some?"

"No… there are some in the vegetable garden though."

"Awesome. I want one."

"We'll get you a karot. Do you know what happened?" Essy asked, still cradling Fengi's head, moving to put it in her lap instead and starting to stroke the young huntress's face.

"It hurt a lot… Then it all got a little weird."

"Could you be more specific?" Linkosta questioned, also kneeling down next to her, already scribbling away.

"Not really.  I… I wasn't me."

"Did you see any images flash, maybe emotions that weren't yours?"

"I was angry… Very angry… and I heard bird song."

"No birds out here, that's for sure. Think she snapped?" Jacky questioned, looking around for any possible stray birds.

"Jacky!" Essy snapped, Jacky raising her hands defensively.

"What?! We just saw her glowing like crazy. Apparently Kalestine talking through her and Yldril just got her mind spanked. I say she just tried sharing a mind with a unicorn."

"It's incredible," Linkosta added, the pen still working furiously. "I've heard of people  sharing thoughts, and mind readers can get some of the same effect at times. You just tried getting… Mind melded?" she continued, not seeming quite sure about the word. "Yeah, let's go with that for the time being. Mindmelded with a unicorn."

"And she liked you," Essy added, while caressing Fengi's cheek.

"And she had a sentence to pass down," Major Jortun added, having walked up next to Rachuck's hand, blade drawn and looking at Yldril. "Decent work, old girl. Little slow on the uptake."

"Dragons can get surprised too you know," Glira replied, the blue dragon clearly keeping very close tabs on Yldril right now. The black dragon was by now full on bawling into the grass, a trickle of acid coming out the sides of her mouth. "Never seen that before. Did you see her tail?!"

"I did. Kulk, mind fetching the tip?"

"Sir, yes, sir," came the quick reply as Kulk trotted off to fetch the lost piece.

"She's in poor shape now, boss," Glira added as she inspected Yldril in greater detail. "She ruined all our good work."

"Then we start over… Can you stand?" the major asked, looking behind him to Fengi.

"I would rather not," came the meek reply as Essy kept stroking her face. Jinora had calmed down a bit and was by now merely sobbing into Sapphire's shoulder, also receiving caring strokes.

"Then simply stay put," the Major said with a kind smile before looking at the rest of them. "To work people. I want that one alive. If nothing else, the inquisition will want her now, that's for damn sure. Stop the bleeding. Glira, pin her like an oiled up green trying to sneak a snack."

"You got it, boss."

"Fucking hell, here we go," Tom went to himself as he felt Jacky draw him in a bit closer.

"You are staying with me for this part."

"Yes, ma'am," he replied with a chuckle, it wasn't like this was funny or anything, but fuck him if he knew what to make of it.

***

"I wanna try sitting up," Fengi had quietly stated after a few minutes of staring at the sky. She'd been given water, some trail mix, and what was left of the candy they had used for Jinora. It was pretty clear this had taken its toll on Fengi, yet she hadn't passed out this time.

Linkosta believed it to be due to her not having been the source of the energy for the effect, whatever it might have been.

Yldril, for her part, hadn't moved a muscle willingly or otherwise since the event. She was just lying there crying. A several hundred year old black dragon. A veteran of both slave labour and likely quite a few battles. She was crying like a little girl and had been at it for minutes by now.

It did at least mean she hadn't resisted their attempts to fix her up once again. She did whimper in pain when something particularly nasty was done, but she didn't fight it. Nor could they get any kind of proper response out of her.

"Feeling dizzy or anything?" Linkosta asked, Saph noting Kulk was paying very close attention right now.

"No, just sore… and tired," Fengi replied, sounding exactly as spent as she looked.

"When you can manage it, maybe you should try giving Yldril a command," Linkosta added, seeming to have finally concluded her note taking.

"Just… maybe a few more minutes."

"It might drain her even more. I wouldn't try it," Essy added, clearly very concerned. "And Yldril isn't doing anything right now anyway."

Saph just nodded as she kept stroking Jinora. "And by the sounds of it, Jinora is just fine. Scared, but fine."

"Sorry… This is just very exciting. Can you still hear or feel Kalestine in any way?" Linkosta asked, eagerness clearly not dampened by either crying kids or dragons.

'And here we thought the academy might temper you a bit… oh we were fools,' Saph sighed to herself, glaring at the young mage.

"Don't think so. Not hearing voices or anything if that's what you mean."

"Okay then… not… lingering," Linkosta muttered to herself as she wrote a bit more. "What about Yldril?"

"Nothing," Fengi just replied flatly after a brief pause to think.

"Maybe just let her rest. Go look at some of the fascinating injuries Yldril just acquired. Surely that's worth your time," Essy said with just a hint of sternness in her voice as she glared at the mage before turning back to look down at Fengi. "Just you relax , okay? You did amazing today already."

"Thanks," Fengi replied with a sigh. "I don't have to do it again, right?"

"No, no you don't," Essy chuckled with a warm smile. "Just rest. We will take care of the rest."

Saph just nodded her assent to that part, still clutching a trembling Jinora.

"I think we should take the little one home. She needs her friends."

"I told you we should have tried the horn first," Rachuck grumbled, his concern seemingly having failed to leave him.

"And then we wouldn't have gotten to see whatever that was. Do you have any idea what we just saw? If Kulinger was here, we would be prying him off the ground cause he wouldn't stop praying!" Linkosta replied incredulously. "We just saw a unicorn take over, not just the kid she saved, but the person holding her too."

"Yes, because we put said kid in danger."

"She wasn't in any danger, she just thought she was," Jortun added. "Yldril couldn't reach her. Glira did her job."

"Quite the gamble, don't you think?" Rachuck retorted, turning his attention to Jortun instead. "With a child of less than TWO!"

"You two stop your shouting," Saph snapped in a more hushed tone as Jinora ducked back under her armpit, sniffling once more. "I'm taking her home, and you go sort that out someplace else… It isn't fair to Fengi either."

Rachuck just grumbled a bit before looking to the major who gave Saph a courteous nod before walking off, gesturing for Rachuck to follow.

Saph had continued to calm down the little one before sitting down next to Fengi. "You wanna say hi to Fengi? She's alright too," she tried in the warmest, most caring voice she could manage.

Jinora did peek out from her little hiding spot to look up at Fengi, who in turn just smiled weakly.

"I'm okay. Don't worry."

Jinora didn't look particularly happy, eyes once more tearing up, though she did reach out for Fengi. Saph put the kid in Fengi's lap, Jinora hugging the young huntress, tears still in her eyes.

"It's okay. I'm fine. You were such a brave little girl," Fengi crooned, patting Jinora on the back before clutching her slightly. "Such a good girl."

"I think Jin might need to get back with the other kids," Essy added, watching the interaction. "This has clearly been a lot. Maybe entrust her back with Lothal. She likes him a lot."

"Not a bad idea," Saph replied, nodding before getting up.

"And you need rest too, Saph. You still look like that's painful."

"It is," Saph reiterated with a shrug.

"All the more reason."

"She needs it too," Saph replied, giving Fengi a pat on the back. "We'll get a tent or something and make do."

"Couldn't you stay Saph? Fengi tried in a meek voice. Just in case I need someone scared off"

"Hah. You don't think Essy can manage that?"

"She's getting the tent, you shouldn't be hauling looking like that," Fengi replied, turning to essy instead with pleading eyes.

Essy didn't look convinced before Fengi laid her hand on Essy's thigh, looking up at her. "Please?... Also, I'm not using magic," she let out after realizing what she had just done.

Essy just smiled warmly, caressing her face. "I know… Fine, I'll get a tent for you and take Jinora back. I think we can get away with borrowing Tom's for now. I'll send Unkai too. If nothing else, he might fix up Saph a little."

Fengi just nodded slightly before looking at Saph.

"Hey, I am not leaving you if that's what you are scared of," Saph chuckled, giving Fengi a bit of a side hug before turning down to Jinora. "Okay, you are going with Essy now. Can you say Essy?"

"Esski," Jinora went, looking up still with tears in her eyes.

"Awww," Saph let out involuntarily as she picked the kid up, giving her a bump with her snout before handing Jinora off to Essy. "Be a good girl now. We'll be back tomorrow I hope."

"Sapir."

"AWWWW!"

***

It had certainly been yet another eventful day as Tom sat staring at the flames of the fire they had used to cook some dinner. Glira had not left Yldril ever since the incident, but Jacky and a few of the others had managed to go to the dumping site and at least salvage a little of the meat. So tonight's menu was this strange colorful goose and some completely brown and green colored ducks with only some bread on the side.

Fengi was sleeping like a rock inside his old tent along with Sapphire; Essy and Unkai were inside keeping an eye on them. Tom knew the older woman cared a lot for Fengi, but it probably helped that the position came with a warm sleeping bag too. And Unkai had apparently been spared to help Saph a little more. Tom had to admit she had to be a damn tough bastard after the bandages were taken off so Unkai could work his magic.

She had looked lucky to still have both of her eyes. She had caught him staring too, looking away and not seeming too happy with the situation. Jacky had been right on point though, cracking jokes at Sapphire's expense, much to Tom's dismay. His surprise had been equal when Saph cracked a smile at it and started firing back about Jacky's slightly wounded arm.

Now though, it was just Jacky, Jortun, and himself around the fire, not counting a few of Glira's crew who were more busy tending to Yldril and Glira herself. She had earned a few scratches after all, and they did need at least cleaning.

"Well you got your camping trip," Jacky goaded him as she munched down on a gose leg.

"I guess so… At least Yldril stopped crying."

"She's sleeping," Jortun added, taking a bite of his own dinner. "Gods know she needs it."

"Feeling sorry for a traitorous mercenary?" Jacky questioned with slight amusement in her voice.

"If she doesn't live, we won't know what was done to her."

"Ohhh," Jacky replied, with what Tom knew as genuine surprise.

"Guess I don't need to ask if that whole thing was normal?" Tom asked, looking up at the major.

"Never seen nor heard of it. I've heard tales of a unicorn forcing someone to act against their will. Or passing down cruel judgments and punishments, as well as great boons. But never through someone else, let alone two. And an Enchantress at that. This may never have happened before."

"So you mean a slow day around here," Jacky joked with a cocky grin, one which the major did respond to with a chuckle.

"It is certainly far from a normal place, this keep. Once this is all over and done, there will be many good tales to be told."

"Aww. We can do more than make tales… Though if you're into that business, you know who needs to be mentioned."

"Jackalope Furlong… Dragon slayer," the major chuckled in reply. "I reckon you can earn a free drink or two with that story."

"I've always wanted to do that… Have a story that's mine," Jacky replied with a genuine smile on her face as Tom turned to look at her.

"I think you've gotten quite a few by now," he chuckled, receiving a confused look from Jacky, which soon turned to realization.

"Oh, you mean netting you. Well I guess that is quite one of a kind."

"I am not going to be dangling from your wall," Tom retorted with a laugh, the two others joining in.

"What would I put you up there for. Much easier to bring you with to show off."

"Hey!" Tom laughed, feigning insult as he shook his head, looking back into the fire. "But no, you are worth telling stories about."

"Says the only human in the world!" Jacky chuckled sarcastically, uncorking her drinking horn and taking a draught before holding it over.

"Nah, I don't much like that spruce stuff."

"It's good for the body, ale's for the soul."

"Only cause you refuse to eat your damn veggies."

"Hey, I like corn," Jacky replied with a laugh. "Besides, an egg is nearly a vegetable too."

"That doesn't count," Tom chuckled, taking out his own water skin instead. "You need to be educated in the merits of the glorious potato. They can make anything, fra vodka till fritter."

"Gods you sound strange in your own tongue," the major added before shaking his head a little. "It better be Joelina that shows up."

"Why?" Tom questioned, not sure where he was going with this.

"Because I believe she might leave you alone if you do what she wants."

"As opposed to stealing everything and then either wiping us off the map or forcefully hiring the lot of us?" Tom replied dryly.

"Indeed. I just hope Victoria knows her as well as she thinks."

"Couldn't we just, like, tell them no? We have the blessing of a unicorn, go away," Jacky added, sounding a bit dubious.

"I mean do we though?" Tom had to ask, looking to Jortun, who just shook his head.

"No, you have a child blessed by a unicorn through a heretical act. Truly a conundrum from anyone more devoted to the faith."

"Well maybe the Inquisition won't know what to do either then," Jacky added optimistically.

"They certainly won't agree with themselves," Jortun admitted with a sigh. "I believe you have two options when it comes to it. You can trust Joelina, assuming she is indeed the one to come here, or you can hold her prisoner."

At that Jacky just spat out her newest sip of spruce beer, most of Glira's crew joining her in staring at the major.

"You didn't just say that."

"No, you can't put her in a cell. But you can impose demands. She wants what's in the vaults, and she will get it. But she needs you," he continued, pointing a clawed finger at Tom, staring him down. "You are her key. Either you cooperate fully or you make it known that you want something in return. I think you could name quite the steep price."

"You want me to withhold knowledge from the Inquisition."

"Don't lie to me. You are already planning on that option, the question is what, if you tell her you are doing so."

"But can't she like, pluck things from your mind?" Jacky asked, clearly skeptical.

"Indeed. But not without making an enemy of you. And what use is a book you don't understand?"

"She can't get it cause he speaks like he's strange in the head?" Jacky asked bluntly, Tom looking at her not quite sure what to make of that.

"No, though it might help. She has access to a wealth of knowledge already, but she doesn't understand how to use it. At least if the Investigator was to be believed."

"So even if she can pluck it, she won't get everything."

"And thus still needs you. Another Inquisitor might just rip what they can out of you and call it a day. Quite likely before executing you for being a threat. But I think she needs you not only alive, but as a friend."

"And you are telling me this now why?"

"Because you need to make one of your demands the secrecy of Jinora's gifts."

"Because?" Tom questioned leadingly, waiting for an answer.

"Because, the Church will want her. And they will take her by any means necessary."

"And what means would those be?"

"Our church is far from fangless my friend, they are no standing army. But taking a small keep like this, even defended as it is?... That's well within their grasp."

"Oh, for fucks sake." Tom let out burying his head in  his hands.

"Unlike you people though, the Inquisition is highly adept at keeping secrets."

"So what else could I ask for… That they leave us mostly alone here?"

"Sounds reasonable. The investigator sounded like that was their original plan. Leave you to your work, likely provide you with what you need. And if you wish to stay as far away from any big city and the political turmoil within, all the better for Joelina and Jinora."

***

Saph was lying in a nice comfy sleeping bag, eyes closed and pretending to be sleeping. By the sounds of it, Fengi was sleeping soundly. She just thanked the gods she had been sleeping by the time Unkai had gotten there. Because of course the guy had been too shy to wake her up, and she had some damn questions.

She had let him fix her face up first though, and she had slightly hoped Essy would leave, but after some time it had become clear that wasn't happening. Some time to think hadn't hurt. That and she wanted to make sure Fengi was in fact sleeping, unlike herself.

"So… little guy… mind telling us what's going on?" Saph asked and she heard the young guard give a little start as she spoke.

"Do you mean like generally or…" he tried, clearly aiming to deflect the question.

"No, you know what I mean. You're scared of Fengi."

"No I'm not."

"Stop insulting me. Why?" Saph retorted, opening her eyes and turning her head to stare at him from the comfort of her sleeping bag.

"I'm not!" he tried more fervently, receiving a shush and a stern glare from Essy for his troubles.

"She needs you, dude. She's more scared than you right now," Saph replied, turning her gaze to Essy, who was looking at Saph with a rather worried expression.

"Well what am I supposed to do about it?"

"Be there for her," both Saph and Essy replied in unison. He just looked ashamed, ears drooping and turning to look at the ground. "How can that be so hard? You like her… Right?" Saph asked, voice wavering a little. She really hoped she was at least right on that one. How couldn't she be?

"She's a monster. I love a monster," he broke out, looking back up, switching his pleading gaze between the two of them.

"Don't you ever say that," Essy snapped, grabbing him by the snout. "She might actually believe you."

"She already does to an extent," Saph added in, staring mournfully at the healer before shaking her head slightly. "You can't let her hear it from you."

"Oh, come on, we've only been together for a little bit… not like she would listen to me on most things anyway."

"No, but she considers you a good person… perhaps even a bit too good."

"Which is why she did find you a touch boring," Essy added frankly.

"In other words, if you tell her she's a monster, she will believe you." Saph clarified, trying her best to sound sincere.

"But I've seen what she can do… Hell there is a rather big piece of evidence lying outside."

"So is Baron a monster too?" Saph questioned rhetorically. "She's powerful. Possibly extremely powerful. But she's still Fengi, isn't she?"

"I have no idea." Unkai admitted looking shamefully at the ground.

"Slap him," Saph commanded, looking to Essy, who diligently complied with a rather strong whap across his face.

"She damn near cried her heart out when the major told her about some of the possible consequences. She's scared shitless of what she can do and what it means. For a minute she even belived the only reason anyone liked her was because of her magic, which is fucking oxshit by the way. We checked. She is still Fengi. Hell, if you're smart you will use the fact she's gonna be needing a little boring in her life."

"But what if she gets mad at me? She could make me do anything."

"She's Fengi. She's the sweetest girl anywhere around. Worst she might ever do is tell you to go away."

"But she could make me slit my own throat with just a single fit," he pleaded with them, Essy once again shushing, this time both of them.

"She would never do that," Saph tried, doing her best to sound angry in a hushed tone.

"My grandma did."

"Your what?!" Saph whisper-shouted, tilting her head at him, Essy simply gaping at him.

"My grandma made my grandfather kill himself. Don't know why exactly. Family always claimed it was just some petty squabble."

"You said your grandpa commited suicide," Essy replied in a confused voice.

"Which is technically accurate. And she was quietly executed for it. Official story reads 'Suicide due to grief,' " he replied, looking devastated. "They had been married for over forty years, then just like that. Snap."

"But… you can control magic," Saph tried. "I don't use mine by accident."

"Well she already has," he whispered as if suddenly afraid Fengi might hear him now all of a sudden.

"And do you think she's happy about that?"

"No, obviously," he relented, looking down at the floor.

"Then help her. Please. You love her, so trust her."

"Not like she couldn't kill you before if she got mad enough," Essy added, looking very sad.

"No, but pretty hard to do it by accident," Unkai all but whined.

'Fucking coward,' Saph just cursed to herself. "You got a medal for trying to save people. Just get in there and give her a damn hug," Saph sighed.

Unkai didn't respond, just giving them a low nod before going over to Fengi's sleeping bag, slipping in, and cuddling up with some effort, Fengi letting out a few low grunts before pulling a smile in her sleep.

"Thanks man… She needs you," Saph said, doing her best to put on a smile too, before nodding to Essy. "I'm going outside for a bit."

"Good idea, leave them to it for a bit" the older huntress replied, also getting up to open the tent zipper thingy.

"So, how are we looking back there?" Vulzan questioned looking at them. It had been five years since last she was in the capital, she might even get to see some of her siblings. The last time she had been there Haiko was trying to become a tavern guard and Viper was supposedly a trader escort now, so there was a chance she would see them both.
"Ready as we'll ever be" Dakota retorted. It had taken some thought to decide who would be going. In the end, they had settled on Sapphire, Dakota, and Balethon.
Dakota had demanded to go. Swearing vengeance on Lady Flaxen for attacking her childhood best friend, she and Esmeralda had practically grown up together. Nunuk and Apuma couldn't be spared due to Esmeralda's condition. With Jarix and Tom helping they shouldn't have much trouble with securing food though. That meant Sapphire had been allowed to go, since sending Jackalope really wasn't gonna do much good and Fengi would rather not go back.
Rachuck had decided that Balethon was the best pick to send. Probably because there was no way of getting Kokashi to leave Esmeralda or their children. Dakota had wanted Unkai, but Rachuck claimed he needed his healer if things got rough while they were gone. Besides they did have Dakota if they ended up needing some emergency medical aid.
So Balethon it was. Sapphire was at least hoping he would find someone other than her to shower with praise for some of the time. It was going to be a long flight and as much as she enjoyed being told how beautiful or awesome she was, there came a point where it just got repetitive. Looking around Vulzan's escorts there were a few candidates to choose from, not to mention a few which were clearly eying Sapphire. She just crossed her fingers that they were less persistent than Balethon, there might even be a funny one among them you never know.
"Cargo secure" one of the escorts shouted back to Vulzan.
"Right then all good back here Arch"
"Very good, hang on then" Sapphire grabbed the thick netting running across Archeon's back as the dragon got to his feet and began running along, Baron had already taken to the sky. They were not in too much of a hurry though, Archeon was faster flying even with cargo on board, thanks to his sleeker frame.
A considerable amount of that cargo had been left behind, which of course didn't hurt his speed either. Vulzan had of course seen his chance to bring in more metal for Tom and Jarix had managed to convince his father that they deserved a great price. The young dragon had even paid for much of it himself, to everyone's surprise.
They took to the air waving at everyone who had come out to say goodbye. Sapphire did have a bit of a knot in her stomach, leaving Esmeralda, but both Nunuk and Apuma had promised that she would be fine. The trip to the capital would likely take them close to a week each way, and who knew how long they would need to stay in the capital. Sapphire had never had to attend a court hearing. She had only looked at the building when passing above it a few times.
Jackalope and Fengi had come along either side of them to give a flying send-off.
"Good luck you're gonna need it" Jackalope shouted jokingly.
"Don't get killed," Fengi had added in a slightly more worried voice.
"You first" Sapphire had retorted with as much confidence as she could muster. These were trying times, but damn if life had been this exciting in years.
"We'll stay in touch" Dakota shouted at them. Sapphire smirked looking at the new earring their fearless leader was wearing. Just because it had been in the service of evil didn't mean it couldn't be useful after all.
Jackalope and Fengi both peeled off rolling into spinning dives, clearly trying to show off a bit one last time. Scoring a few shouts of approval from the escorts currently perched around Archeon. Dakota, Sapphire, and Balethon added in, those were two of their own after all.
As Archeon continued to climb the keep was soon getting rather small behind them, Baron was dead ahead and getting bigger, it took a minute or two before they were up alongside. Archeon had offered to take point, but Baron had refused. He was both the larger and older dragon here and as such would fly as formation lead. Even if Archeon was better suited to break the wind for them.
As they settled into cruising speed at a safe altitude above the ground, people started getting up and walking around a bit, setting down for a chat and a game or two. The three of them had just huddled together, they had gotten out the winter coats for this trip else they might very well risk freezing up from sitting still in this wind, especially if they hit bad weather. Right now though the weather was beautiful, with plenty of sun and only a few clouds.
Sapphire wondered if she could get Dakota to spill the beans on what Tom had offered to Jarix. She had never even heard of a Royal guard dragon agreeing to plow a field. Hell, even those considered honest working dragons would be hard to coax into such a job. And he had paid for some of what was technically their supplies and that was definitely supposed to be the other way around.
"So, I heard Jarix agreed to pretty much be Tom's beast of burden. How did that happen?"
"Yeah, that was quite the scene let me tell you. Tom got all philosophical again."
"He managed to talk Jarix into it?" Sapphire replied in disbelief. Sure Tom had a bit of a silver tongue, but that was simply too much to believe. Dakota leaned over clearly trying to be subtle.
"He promised Jarix a machine gun, as well as fighting alongside him in defense of the keep." Sapphire could see how that would do it. Kinda explained the dragon's extreme generosity as well.
"I'm allowed to know?" Balethon questioned, as he waited his turn. Only Vulzan and Tyborg had been allowed to witness the evening lesson. So they needed to be a bit careful about what they said. Tom had clearly been very determined not to let what was shown there become common knowledge.
Dakota obliged, the look on his face became one of understanding.
"Whatcha talking about" one of the escorts questioned "Something we are allowed to hear?"
"Unfortunately not sorry" Dakota replied, in a stern yet apologetic voice.
"Nah I get it, that Tom guy has secrets to keep and I sure as shit ain't gonna be crossing him. Care for a game?" Why hadn't she thought of that, Sapphire cursed herself.
"Sure whatcha got?" Dakota replied for them.
"Come on over gonna play one-up" 'Oh no not the weird metaphor stuff' Sapphire thought to herself. Still, it would help pass the time and she was bound to become bored with looking at the horizon eventually.
They had gathered a handful of people on the centerline of Archon's back. The netting helped, but this would have been easier to do on Barron. Some of the escorts were hanging down the sides of the dragon. They looked comfortable enough though, dangling from the netting.
"I am a kid I see the joy in everything" the one next to Dakota went, the game was already going then, brilliant.
"I am a nightmare, I prowl the dark" Dakota continued.
"I am a torch, I keep the darkness away" heh, that was easy.
"I am water, I drown the fire" 'ha suck on that one, Bale boy'
"I am human I love water" the one next to Sapphire went, clever 'little bastard' the next one in line wondered for a bit.
"Da fuck beats him?" he went in a genuinely curious voice.
Sapphire pondered a bit. The vargufl's had sorta managed it.
"Corruption?" one of the others went shrugging his shoulders looking at the trio from the keep as if they should know.
"No clue actually" Dakota finally replied. You got one Sapphire? thinking back there was one thing he had yet to manage with any sort of grace.
"Girls" Sapphire finally went. "He's got no clue there"

"Hey, Shiva watch this" Tom took a sip of the first jar of finished fuel. The hydrometer claimed it was between 94% and 95% and that was good enough for Tom. "I am Baron, I am mighty"
It had been a while since Tom last tried this trick but it was always a party favorite, as long as you didn't do it indoors and especially near curtains... This was a smithy though so he was sure it would be fine.
"Shit! What the hell?!" Wiperna let out in alarm, Shiva just had a hearty chuckle.
"Oh yeah, it certainly burns alright. Doesn't even taste that shit anymore, nice and pure. Don't drink it though there might still be methanol in there." Tom went putting away the lighter.
"Which is?" Shiva questioned, clearly expecting an explanation.
"Makes you go blind if you have too much, so just don't." Shiva eyed the glass jar he was holding a bit.
"I will take your word for it."
"On second thought, I should probably mix this with petrol right away" Tom had a feeling Shiva's word might not be so sound on this point. The annoyed twitch on her face told him he was probably right.
Making what was essentially E85 would help a great deal with storage too, not to mention the bike would likely run a lot better on that, than pure alcohol.
"If you insist on drinking it, do try and take the stuff from the middle of the process, that should be mostly pure" A hint of a smile crept onto Shiva's face as she crossed her arms.
"I insist." Tom wrote of the afternoon's scheduled work on the engine housing as he doubted the smith would be much help then.
Baron had departed that morning to transport the bitch and her accomplices back to the capitol. Hashaw had promised she would face some considerable punishment but didn't elaborate further. Tom has asked Nunuk and Apuma what sort of punishment would be expected for something like this.
The answer had been a mixed bag. They were hoping that her position as a city warden was at the very least done for. There would also be reparations to be paid, both to Esmeralda and Nunuk. There was even a chance they could get something for what Dashu had caused if the judge was feeling vindictive that day. Nunuk was also hopeful that she would face prison time and if her family didn't decide to back her up, there was a good chance it would actually stick.
Tom had hoped for something like taking her wings, but hurting a noble sounded a lot more tricky than it should. Then again it wasn't much better back home. The idea of buying your way out of jail had apparently made it through their rather strict honor code around here, which was a bit of a disappointment too.
Judging by Hashaw's demeanor when she left, there was every chance some political favors were going to be pulled in the other direction too though. Dakota had gone along to try and make use of what connections they had, should it become necessary, as well as testifying of course.
In other news. Esmeralda was also doing much better, though she was still resigned to the bed for a bit longer. Apparently the more rest she got the fewer lasting side-effects she would suffer. That poison was a truly vile thing. Tom knew of nerve-agents and things like mustard gas. This stuff seemed almost like it tried to eat you, in that sense, it was more of a chemical weapon than poison or venom as the dragonettes referred to it. That alone sent shivers down his spine. If he ever came across a green dragon he would make sure to keep his distance since anything that could survive having that in its mouth was bound to be bad news.
Apuma had promised that Esmeralda would get back to her feet and make at least close to a full recovery. She would need to continue eating that foul-smelling stuff he had made though. For that, they had gotten a shopping list of things they needed from the forest. Since they were down to Fengi and a one-handed Jackalope, it had been decided it was as good a time as any to take their newest members on their first hunt and foraging expedition.
Fengi and Jackalope had already departed, taking Wiperna and Zarko with them to help out. They were to start gathering up what they could find in terms of herbs and game. Then Jarix could just haul it all back and not have to sit around waiting for too long. Jarix hadn't objected though he seemed a bit skittish about letting Zarko go on ahead.
Tom had brought up an empty fuel can and a full one and showed Shiva and Raoulf how to mix it. It wasn't a difficult procedure so he left them to it, crossing his fingers that they would still be able to see when he got back. Then he had grabbed his parachute and made for the greeting hall where Jarix and Radexi were already waiting.
"So ready for takeoff?" Tom went upon rounding the corner.
"Buckles are tight and checked," Radexi answered in an optimistic tone.
"Do I get the special treatment or do you wanna see me try climbing again?"
"Come on up, that was funny though," Jarix replied, lowering a wing. As Tom walked up he felt a little bad his boots weren't cleaner. It almost felt like there should be a welcome mat or something. Walking on the soft springy membrane was an odd sensation too. He felt more like he was walking on a bouncy castle than anything. "Tom, you do know the way right?" Tom hadn't known Jarix that long, but that sounded like masked confidence to Tom.
"Sure been there and back quite a few times"
"Oh good," Jarix replied in a clearly relieved tone.
"What's the matter, not much of a navigator?"
"Uhmmm… no" Jarix replied in an uncertain tone.
"That's what I and Zarko are for when flying. I'm just a backup though." Radexi piped up.
"Jarix, you're 85 and you can't navigate."
"Yes, I can… just not read maps or stars... I don't know where I am right now okay"
"Zarko usually takes care of where we are going," Radexi added, seemingly not concerned.
"Welp, I'm the king of not knowing where I am around here so might as well get going."
"Can't argue with that" Radexi agreed.
"Wait is that good or bad?" Jarix questioned clearly not reassured by that statment.
"Brought my compass we're fine"
"Whats a compass?" Radexi questioned.
"Always points north... Not that great on an island though, it likes to move" Tom had to admit
"ooohhhhh"
"Brilliant three people who don't know where we are and a magic thing that doesn't help here."
"Relax, I have been to the forest a few times."
Jarix got up doing a bit of a jog in place as if hyping himself up. "Okay off we go, hang on back there"
Tom was starting to properly enjoy the feeling of going weightless as they dropped off the edge, then the first wingbeat caught them and they were flying.
"Okay turn right to two o'clock"
"Uhmm what?" Jarix responded.
"Oh right, sorry, turn right to 060 degrees" There was more silence,
"You don't know degrees"
"I have no clue what you are talking about"
"Ohh…. Uhm, right a bit" Tom turned back to Radexi "How do you say  go over there?" Tom pointed to two o'clock.
Radexi squinted a bit "Right turn one-sixth I think"
"That sounds very annoying to use"
"What would you say"
We just go on, two three four five, o'clock and so on up to twelve.
"Why twelve?"
"There are twenty-four hours in a…"
"Would someone tell me where we are going?" Jarix interrupted.
"Right sorry right turn one-sixth"
"Now that wasn't so hard was it?" Jarix replied going into a lazy right turn.
"My system is better you learn it one day"
"Sure it is, hours in the day and turning have so much in common" Jarix replied clearly not convinced by that fact, so Tom turned to Radexi instead.
"Hmpf, right so you see this thing, this is a watch or a clock"
It took a while to explain the concept but at least it helped pass the time. They were discussing degrees when Jarxi interrupted the lesson.
"I see trees"
"Good, head for them. They see us coming I'm sure."
They made for the tree line Tom and Radexi both peering out ahead trying to see if they could spot anyone on the wing.
"Hey, Tom why do you wear those google things in front of your eyes, you know they are black, right?"
"I'm not made to go this fast, they hurt otherwise and they help with the sun too"
"Man you really suck at being up here"
"Hey remember I'm the second most well-armed guy here and only by a little"
"Little, have you ever seen what I can do?" Jarix questioned clearly not believing what he was hearing.
"No" Tom had to admit
"We are here to hunt right?"
"Uhm… yeah"
"Well, what do you say we do some hunting then? The quick way"
"Are you sure that is a good idea?" Tom replied Radexi just looked at Tom violently mimicking a 'Come on, man' with his whole body. "You know what sure, why not. Just don't wipe out an entire herd okay?" Okay, this had the potential to be really awesome.
"Yeah yeah, else the prancy white horse gets mad. I know, I have heard the stories"
"Didn't Nunuk claim you met one?" Radexi asked Tom.
"I did and I agree she was quite annoying. She didn't even like my chainsaw."
"Well, I already like your chainsaw for that reason," Jarix replied. It would seem the reverence for the unicorns was a dragonette thing rather than a draconic thing.
"Oh you will, it made so much noise she had to come to check what was happening" Tom replied laughing
"Okay, now I love it" Jarix retorted. "What does it do?"
"It eats trees" They both laughed a bit at that one.
"Oh I bet she hated that then"
"I don't wanna ruin the mood but do you see anyone?" Radexi interrupted. There was a bit of a pause as they started scanning around them again.
"You are sure they went to this part of the forest right?" Jarix questioned.
"Uhm… I think so"

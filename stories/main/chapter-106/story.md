As they got underway, settling into the cruise, watching the capital shrink away behind them, everyone mostly just took the time to relax a bit. It had been hard work thus far today, getting Arch and the others loaded, but the weather was really nice. Early summer had kicked in nicely with a clear sky and the warming sun. They didn't even need the warm coats in fact, though they had them ready just in case.

Ray had fallen asleep not long into the journey, having worked as hard as she could with loading the dragons, clearly trying to repay them despite being told repeatedly she didn't need to push that hard. It had been a hard sell though, as everyone else was told to hurry up since they were late and all. The excitement of going flying again and the fact it was as part of one hell of a formation had kept her awake, but only for a while.

Looking to both so sweet and so sad sight, Sapphire shook her head with a chuckle as she leaned back reveling in the sun. They would have Ray on her feet in no time back at the keep. The two new huntresses, though, were clearly still trying to come to terms with just what they had gotten themselves into.

"Okay, I have to know, just why exactly do you need this much material?" Pho questioned, taking her eyes off Baron, the huntress not doing a brilliant job of hiding that she was probably a little jealous of Junior right now.

"Yeah, and why is a crazy inventor going to a frontier keep?" Bo echoed, looking towards Tink.

"Great ideas don't come from average minds," Tink replied, his eyes locked on Glira, who was taking up the rear of the diamond formation. 'Touche,' Sapphire mused to herself, happy that at least the inventor had some self-awareness.

"No, but seriously, there is more metal here than I have ever heard of a little frontier keep using in a decade. We sure didn't, back where I came from," Pho reiterated, looking around for someone to answer her.

"Well, let's just say Tink is not gonna be the craziest person you are gonna meet," Sapphire, replied with a smile. She didn't need to be vague. They would know soon enough, and everyone on Archeon's back either already knew or were going to.  Glira, Grevi, and their crews probably shouldn't be told more than necessary just yet though.

"Understatement of the century," Balethon added with a snicker, looking at the two now even more confused girls.

"This Tom guy, right? Why does he need all this?" Bo asked again, with a shrug holding up her hands in confusion.

"Oh, he just needs the materials to make things," Saph replied. "He makes a lot of strange inventions."

"I get that," Bo retorted, not sounding very impressed by that explanation.

"Like the pen thing you were using?" Pho added, clearly not buying that entirely either.

"Yes, I'm so excited! But look at that beauty," Tink interrupted, pointing back to Glira, who clearly heard him, angling her head to the side with a cocky smile. "I'm so happy they finally saw the merit of those blades. They were so expensive to make."

"I love 'em," came the reply from Glira as she brandished her strange weapons.

"Have you tried them yet?" Tink shouted back at her.

"No not really, but they look wicked!" came the reply, Vulzan facepalming as Archeon let out a sigh.

"If you're such a fan, why don't you go over and get appreciated?" Arch added in.

"No, I need to hear more about Tom. They can tell me now. What else has he made? How does he work? Where does he get such marvelous ideas? Oh, has he got many hands so he can work faster? Maybe he doesn't sleep, that could do it too..."

Sapphire looked to Dakota, hoping she would answer that one, only to find Dakota already looking at her expectantly. 'Goddammit not again.'

"Well… he kinda cheats, I think."

"Huh?" Tink, clearly couldn't quite figure out how you might cheat at inventing things, it also got Bo and Pho's attention.

"Tom both is and isn't an inventor… I think," Sapphire admitted. That was about the best description she could come up with on the spot. "He has brought knowledge from his home, and is doing his best to make it work here."

"Ooohhhh," Tink replied, the notion seemingly clicking for him. "Wait, so how much does he have?"

"We have no idea," Sapphire replied. She genuinely didn't beyond 'a lot.'

"He did claim the con.. cocut… the thinking machine thing could remember more pages than every book in existence," Dakota added in helpfully.

"I'm sorry, what?" Bolinda replied, clearly skeptical once again.

"What's a thinking machine?" Tink interrupted before the young huntress got a chance to get a response.

'Oh boy.'

The next morning Jacky had been the one to wake Tom. He cursed a little at having slept that long, but everything considered, he really couldn't complain. He felt even better by now, the weary fatigue having at least mostly gone. It sounded cliche, but he damn near felt younger, to the point he had to run a hand through his beard to check if it was still there. Hell, even many of the little aches and pains one grew accustomed to with age were gone.

"Is his lordship feeling well-rested?" Jacky joked, rubbing the sleep from her eyes.

"Damn right I am. I feel better than ever. I need to know what was in that bottle."

"Expensive stuff."

"Sounds like it. Anyway, I wanna go climb on the dragon with the kids. You joining?"

"Can we eat at the same time? I'm hungry," came the still slightly sleepy reply as Jacky went about washing off at the basin. "You really like that guy, huh?"

"Come on, have you ever seen a dragon roll around like a happy dog. Jarix sure doesn't do that."

"I don't know what a dog is… wait no, you showed me that strange furry thing."

"A golden retriever," Tom clarified, as Jacky clearly tried to remember.

"It fetches gold? Damn... How do you end up with so much gold you breed an animal to retrieve it for you?"

"It… You know what, yes, we have animals that fetch our gold. They are very good at it."

"I can't help but smell sarcasm right now."

"Noooo, it's genuine," Tom replied with a chuckle, Jacky also cracking a smile.

"I guess that makes Sapphire a dog. Out to fetch our gold for us."

"Hey now, be nice."

"You said you liked dogs?" Jacky protested, doing her best to look confused. To the point, it was abundantly clear she was fucking with him.

"I love em but it's… But it would be a bit like calling her a cow. Sure they are very nice but…"

"All I heard was you calling her a cow. I have to say that is a little rough. I mean she's not me, but still," Jacky replied, doubling down on the sarcasm.

"Oh, you are firing on all cylinders today."

"That sounds like a compliment so I'll take it. Now food!" Jacky replied, putting a shoulder under Tom's belly and lifting him off the ground while he was still fiddling with his boots.

"This doesn't seem very efficient," Tom protested with a laugh as he kept at trying to tie on the boots.

"Food is this way and you are working, so I say we are being very efficient."

Nunuk had asked some questions over breakfast, mainly on how he was feeling and reprimanding them for not coming to find her when he woke up. He was supposed to have slept through most of the day after all.  All the answers had been satisfactory though, so seemingly nothing was wrong.

After breakfast, Nunuk had him and Jacky face off again to try and see if there had been any improvement in that department. To his disappointment, he was still lagging a ways behind what he had been capable of before all this happened in sheer strength. It was definitely an improvement though. He didn't shake, it didn't hurt, and his fine motor skills were working just fine. He still humiliated himself trying to match Jacky for flexibility, but in that department, he was actually better off than ever. He couldn't even remember the last time he had been able to put his palms on the floor. Now though, easy.

Tiguan and Jarix had been busy chatting about everything that had happened out in the greeting hall, Tom taking his food out there to keep an eye on the playing children who had once again flocked to Tiguan when they were done eating, some foregoing the food entirely. The black dragon provided some rather interesting insights into at least some of what had happened in the capital. It was rather clear, though, that Jarix stole the show when it came to storytelling today.

"No way. Shut up," Tiguan objected jokingly, clearly wanting Jarix to go on.

"I'm serious, they could see in the dark. Tom says they can hear where they are going, but that doesn't matter. They can see you."

"Even me?"

"Yeah dude, it doesn't matter, they just know where you are. Still got them though."

"I heard. You should have seen some of the faces when the report was read aloud."

"Baron heard it, right?" Jarix questioned expectantly.

"Eventually. He wasn't too pleased with you not following orders, though that might have been because he lost a bet to your mother on it. Your mother found it hilarious though. Oh, careful now," Tiguan replied as he helped a slightly clumsy Holdey back up onto one of his horns.

"Isn't that annoying?" Jarix questioned yet again, sulking a little at the part about Baron.

"Why? We have crew running around all the time. They are just a little less… organized."

"My crew doesn't mess with my ears," Jarix pointed out, as Kiran went on an even more adventurous climbing expedition, likely trying to outdo Holdey.

"I not messing. I testing," Kiran corrected as he slowly made his way further out onto the large ear. Tiguan swung out the ear, watching his progress closely. "Tom does tests all the time."

"Hey Jacky, think we can compete for most pull-ups from Jarix horns?" Tom questioned with a snicker as he watched the scene.

"No, you may not," Jarix replied, sounding a tad disappointed.

"Oh right, yes. Jarix said you needed just about everything. I could spit some into a jar for you if you want it?"

"Uhm… Sure," Tom replied, not quite sure what kind of container would be proof against dragon acid. "How do you normally do that?"

"I mean… I don't do it often. It's not quite as valuable," Tiguan replied, catching himself from tilting his head after Kiran's protest. "Glass, I think?"

"We have a bit of that I think," Tom replied. They did have at least one empty blitz gel jar, so that would have to do. After some thorough cleaning of course. He had no clue what accidentally mixing those two might result in.

Tom had fetched the jar and cleaned it thoroughly while the others went about saying proper goodbyes to the dragon. Tiguan had places to be, after all, 'cause if the enemy was coming back, then chances were good they would hit Deriva first. So he needed to be there.

Tiguan had taken them down to the ground so he didn't ruin the floor at the keep, Tom setting down the jar. The knowledge this stuff could eat granite reaffirmed his fears that this was to be treated with extreme caution. Apuma had been in possession of a little bit of the stuff in powdered form, but this was ready and dangerous.

Whereas Jarix was only able to spit out rather limited amounts at a time, before needing time to recharge so to speak, Tiguan filled the jar in one go no problem, letting the cloudy gray liquid run down his tongue into the jar with excellent precision. It looked like liquid death, and it smelled like it too.

"It doesn't burn you?" Tom had to ask at the rather odd sight.

"Nah, it tickles a little, but don't touch it. It takes flesh right off the bone," Tiguan warned very sternly. "And don't smell it either, I think that does weird things to you."

"I know, we have strong acids where I come from too. I wonder what kind this is… If it's even one I know?"

"It's black dragon acid," Tiguan replied helpfully, clearly not quite understanding.

"Well yes, but is it *sulfuric*, maybe *nitric*... That would be very useful actually," Tom replied, pondering just what could be made with that.

"I have no idea what those are, but I take it you know what you are doing. The others said so at least."

"Nah, I don't, but I will once we find out what this is."

"Yay, testing!" Kiran added in from his hiding spot on Tom's back for when anything dangerous was happening.

"You get on with that. We really need to get going if we are to reach Deriva before nightfall. It has been a pleasure, and we thank you deeply for the hospitality," Ylditz added in, Tiguan letting down a wing for the lieutenant to walk up.

"Be nice to Ray too, okay? She's very sweet," Tiguan stated, looking to Tom expectantly.

"I promise I'll do my best."

"If nothing else we'll put the parachute on her. It's sorta like flying," Jacky added, the dragon's smile widening as he did a polite and very deep bow with his head, before turning away. Tom stood there watching the kind dragon climb into the sky, hoping the folk at Deriva would do a nice job of welcoming him too.

"Can't you tell him to come back? He was fun," Kiran questioned, crawling back up onto Tom's head.

"Not really. We have Jarix though, he's nice too."

"But he won't let us play on him."

"I think he will in time. Just tell him Tiguan had a stronger ear or something, I think that could work."

Kiran replied with a devious little laugh at that particular idea as Tom sealed up the jar before picking it up to put into storage. Rachuck's armory/bunker idea wasn't done yet. In all honesty, it hadn't even been started yet, so the basement would have to do.

The rest of the day had proceeded rather calmly. Tom and Jacky lent a hand where it was needed. There was still plenty of work to do around the keep to get things back to normal. The crops needed tending badly, after having been neglected for a while. Rachuck wanted ideas on how to improve their defenses. Though that was mostly Tom's fault after he criticized some of the scrounged together barricades that had been built.

Time had flown by, the dinner bell eventually being rung, marking the end of the day's labor, at least for most people.

As they were eating, Esmeralda had emerged from the stairs with Kokashi close behind, though she was walking by herself.

"Hey look who's up and about. Morning, Essy. Sleep well?" Fengi shouted out.

"Oh yeah… That is strong stuff," Essy replied as she came over to sit down. She looked tired as fuck, much like Tom had been the night before, but she was smiling ear to ear.

"So, everything in order?"

"More or less. And I don't need to keep eating the other stuff."

"So, no more painful nights?" Fengi questioned optimistically.

"No more painful nights, no."

A few of the dragonettes let out a cheer for her, Tom joining in, raising the mug of water.

"By the way, they threw the bitch off the edge this morning," Fengi added with a devious smile.

"Wait, what?" Tom demanded. He had forgotten the trial was yesterday, but even so, that was a damn quick process. And they had only been aiming for prison. Essy seemingly thought the same as she turned to Kokashi with an expression of 'WTF,' her husband shrugging apologetically.

"Apparently the inquisition branded her a traitor for messing with some paperwork," Fengi replied, with a grave expression.

"Dumb bitch." Jacky burst out, with a laugh

"She pretty much doomed an entire keep. That's a little more than messing with some paperwork," Anchor protested as he walked by. That led to both Tom and Essy demanding a proper explanation. Nunuk had obliged them after they had finished eating, detailing everything they knew about the situation. It also meant that the trio was likely heading for home tomorrow. New hires, money, and materials in tow.

"We better get started then," Tom replied, the timetable for everything moving up once again.

"And tonight you will do nothing except relax. I demand it," Jacky countered, putting an arm around him and dragging him in close. "I remember how you are with work, so I won't let you get all stressy again."

"Do I get a say in the matter?" Tom questioned, looking up at those two brights if still slightly dark green eyes.

"Nope."

***

Well, the flight hadn't been quite as boring going back home as it had been going out. Partly on account of there being more new people and plenty to talk about when it came to bringing them up to speed. And the fact that Dakota had bought some books that both Tom and Apuma had requested. Why they needed more books was a mystery to her. But most of them were blank, so she guessed that they were planning on maybe translating some things. At least in the future.

Tink's questions had been unending. Sapphire and the others had to admit that they simply didn't know the answers to most of them though. Bolinda had continued to be skeptical, that situation not being helped by their inability to answer things like "How one would make a flying machine that couldn't beat or even flex its wings?"

The weather had held throughout the first three days traveling, and the route was the same as when they had come in. On the third day, they had chosen to brave a storm to make their next overnight halt. The weather had quickly deteriorated way beyond what they had been expecting. That had been a truly shit day, not to mention damn scary, as the storm pushed even Archeon hard to maintain formation. The howling winds and pounding rain had slowly stripped away the dragon's strength. Without him they stood little chance in such weather; they could fly in it, but not for very long. Feeling him strain against the winds, spending precious strength, not knowing when the storm would come to an end before he was spent, was nerve-racking to be sure.

Archeon was a seasoned flyer though, and he was no stranger to storms either, having spent most of his adult life traveling between keeps and the cities. Grevi though was really struggling. The young green dragon folded into the center of the formation, letting the others break the wind for her. Having Baron in the lead definitely paid dividends here, the hulking armored frame of the red bashing a path through the storm, and with a pair of heavily laden blues on the flanks, they had about as sturdy a formation as possible.

That didn't help Sapphire, though, as she hunkered down on Archeon's back, checking the safety lines tying her down and saying her prayers for both herself and the dragon her life now depended on. The screaming winds combined with soaked clothes chilling them all to the bone. Sapphire had hardly been awake by the time the keep came looming out of the storm.

Normally they would have to set up tents for the night, but luckily this was one of the last really major keeps on their route before reaching the middling keeps that heralded the beginning of the frontier.

Saph hadn't had the best experiences with these major keeps in the past. They were way too large to be a proper family. The one they had stayed at the day before, was home to over eight hundred dragonettes and a dragon, at least for a time. There was also the fact that most of the people at such keeps lived outside of it. The keep itself only played host to the noble family and other people of note or higher rank. The keep was built to temporarily shelter everyone during a siege or other such calamity though. That meant there was plenty of space inside for their ragged party.

Touching down in a greeting hall, Grevi had collapsed on the ground, her crew quickly setting about doing what they could to repay her for getting them here unscathed, her lieutenant getting into a rather heated argument with Victoria and Baron about having chosen to brave the storm in the first place. Their little party had set about unloading Archeon to get him out of his harness, to properly rest. The work was slow and tough, near-frozen as they were.

To Saph's relief, the people of the keep had set about helping them, also handing out dry blankets for them, leading them inside after the unloading was done.

As they hobbled inside, dripping wet and miserable, they were served a nice hot meal, even if it was only soup with some bread on the side. Still, it was warm and it was free so she wasn't complaining. 'Gods bless the law of hospitality,' Sapphire reflected as she wrapped up the blanket a bit tighter, waiting for her turn next to the fires.

They had bedded down in the great hall which for this keep lived up to its name, easily accommodating them all. There were already two other traders in the keep, the dragons taking up one of the three sizable greeting halls, the remaining two being given to their formation of four.

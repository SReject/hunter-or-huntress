'Oh gods, could we at least sit down?' Saph thought to herself, despairing. They had been training all day, and even with being afforded a decent break before the last few drills where they would not know what Glira and her crew would try, they were still completely worn out by now. Yet Dakota was seemingly not. Nor was Tom, of course, but that was hardly unusual, and they had both spent much of the day riding with Jarix after all.

They were all gathered around a table in the grand hall to discuss how things had gone. The table had been dragged over towards where the hatch up under the roof was located so Jarix could also see the table in question. Sapphire's main complaint was the fact that the benches had been left where they were to make room for more people around the table.

The keep had been thoroughly trashed during the final exercise, fancy weaponry notwithstanding. Had it been for real, Saph still felt reasonably sure they would have won. Certainly, if Glira and her crew didn't know ahead of time what they were in for, like any future hostiles hopefully wouldn't. That sadly did not excuse them from trying to do better.

"No, Dakota, the strategy was sound, but the execution was lacking," Victoria replied as they moved the small wooden pieces back to the starting points. "You will simply have to train such maneuvers more frequently in the future."

"If that is the case then we shouldn't have used it during a final exercise. We should have run through it during the earlier stages of the day."

"Perhaps, but there was no time to train for every contingency."

"In which case I should not order them to do something which I should be fully aware of them not being able to pull off reliably."

Saph saw Essy shrink a little out of the corner of her eye. Dakota would never blame her lifelong friend for what had happened, even if it was Essy who had misunderstood the signal and intercepted Glira's crew head on rather than going to follow them from behind. It was an honest mistake. Saph still wasn't even sure it counted as a mistake since it was a perfectly viable tactic in that situation and one often used. But apparently not in this case for some reason.

'I'm fucking happy I'm not the one leading if you have to know what Dakota is thinking all the time.'

Next to her, Fengi had been getting a little anxious, or at least as anxious as you could get while so tired you might be ready to drop dead. Pho sorta had, laying down flat on the floor in protest. The greenhorns had done well enough. They had certainly kept up, which was hardly surprising for racers, but only Bo seemed to have any real eye for tactics. Perhaps one day she could make a decent formation lead.

"I won't argue that," Victoria finally relented, clearly reluctant to do so as she leaned back, crossing her arms.

Dakota just leaned forward harder, both arms planted on the table, a slight sneer on her face, eyes darting over the pieces. "If I ordered a general retreat they would have flown over to the keep. Glira would get her run nonetheless, but she would be vulnerable to a counter."

"Indeed, though she would be coming out of a dive. Her speed would be quite high, and the huntresses would only catch her for but a moment."

"With some of our new weaponry a moment will do. Firing from above, Sapphire's arrows will not struggle for range."

Victoria did not have an easy counter for that one, rubbing her chin slightly, thinking. "It may not hit… but if it does, it could put her out of the fight. Sapphire, if you get such a chance, don't waste your time on the head and neck. Too slender of a target, and able to dodge if they see your arrow coming. Between the wing shoulders."

"Yup, center of mass will be harder to move out of the way," Tom agreed, the human likely having picked up on something he actually understood well enough about the day's fighting.

"Quite… an-"

"And she's eating dirt if you hit her there," Jarix joined in enthusiastically. The dragon had been quite pleased with his performance today, even if he too seemed rather worn out. The enthusiastic smile did wash away swiftly following a scathing look from Victoria though.

"And a hit to the chest would still see her gravely wounded, and I need not explain to you what shattering her spine would entail." She continued, the dragon looking away for a moment.

"Well she can't use her tail for starters, hehe," Balethon added in with a chuckle, tapping the ground with the wood and metal prosthetic attached to his backside. Anchor rolled his eyes at the shitty joke while Rachuck just shook his head.

"And with her retreating as a minimum and perhaps down for good it would be two on one," Rachuck added, gathering up the remaining three pieces. "If they run, the huntresses will harry them all the way out. If they fight, only we would give them melee with the huntresses picking off stragglers. If they try to engage the huntresses closely, they will be outrun."

"Though you must be careful not to let us chase your huntresses away from the field. We may manage to run while pursuing you if you are not careful. Herded like sheep. Even if pursued, stick with your other formations," Major Jortun grumbled, sliding the two blue pieces together. "I have seen it done many times before against undisciplined fighters."

"Not that I think we will find that here," Victoria added, pointedly throwing a look Rachuck's way.

The captain had given her a run for her money more than once. He did of course have superior numbers and the shotguns on his side, but it was rather hard to agree on just how effective the guns would be before they truly tried to test them out. And well, that was a day best left waiting.

"I will try to remember it," Essy spoke up, clearly uncomfortable, keeping her head low. The others hadn't even been looking at her, but they all turned to pay attention. Rachuck nodded sagely, Victoria and Jortun glanced first to each other then to Dakota, not seeming so sure, while the gilded huntress just looked at her old friend's face, worry starting to show on her own.

"Essy… none of this is your fault, I should have known what you would do."

"No you shouldn't, it was a mistake. You shouldn't predict mistakes. I thought you wanted us to do a Reji Cut, not a… I don't even remember what it's called," Essy blurted out, clearly distraught. "I'm not much of a soldier."

"On the frontier we always end up being a bit of both," Rachuck added calmly. "This is what practice is for. And we have not had enough lately."

There was a collective groan from the guards, likely having heard that line many times before. They had played their part well too. All the extra time spent on said practice while the huntresses were busy putting food on the table had indeed shown.

"We're gonna be doing more of this then? When? In between debarking logs and doing laundry?" Balethon had questioned, speaking everyone's mind.

"If necessary," the captain replied unfazed, looking to Jacky, who was indeed quite worn out too. Her heavy armor didn't do much for endurance when flying, but at least she had not needed to keep up with the other huntresses today. "For starters, we need to make better use of our latest asset."

"Hehe… yeah," Jacky replied sheepishly with a forced smile on her face, shrinking a little. "I'll try not to get in the way next time."

"Of course, though some sparring practice would not go amiss either. Whenever you do not feel the need to act as Tom's personal bodyguard."

Tom pulled her in a little closer, a hand patting her on the mithril armored back. "I think I could survive for a little bit at least."

Jacky didn't exactly look sold on the idea, but she didn't say anything to counter it either, likely resigned to her fate. Saph knew she quite enjoyed sparring after all. At least when she was winning. The burly woman had been the only problem child for the guard's formation today, but that was hardly surprising. She had never trained with the guards in the air, and she had little training fighting like they did at all. The large, heavy-set woman had rather managed to mess up Twitch's day though after the demolition expert had failed to notice her diving down towards him in the middle of a big melee. Normally when practicing you would pull up to avoid collision so the defending flier could dive down freely to get away.

Jacky had indeed pulled up, believing the small guy had seen her. He had not. The resulting collision as he beat upwards to altitude had apparently knocked him out cold. Jacky had reported barely feeling anything aside from her fingers aching and a bit of a headache as the armor drew from her to soften the blow. The enchantments may even have saved the man's life, alongside the fact that he had been relieved of any explosive components prior to going airborne.

There had been some debate on how long he had been out for though; it was certainly quite convenient that he woke up just after Jacky had finished carrying him back to the keep. Everyone had taken the chance to get something to drink, and Tom had as always come through for them -In the shape of candy.

All the huntresses had eagerly scarfed down the sweet treat. Sapphire had barely even taken the time to savor it as they climbed back up to continue the exercises. It did wonders, for a short while. But then it all fell apart. It had been humiliating as they were forced to retreat and admit they couldn't fight on. Victoria and Jortun had of course worked out what had happened. They didn't say anything aside from advising that they bring enough sweets for the whole fight if they felt like doing it for real.

"Either way that is a future concern… I think this is going to be all for today," Dakota sighed, finally standing up straight after having been hunched over the table for the whole conversation. "Get some rest."

"Cheers to that," Saph said with a sigh of relief, the sentiment soon echoed by most of the people around the table.

"Inquisitor Harvik! What a pleasant surprise! To what do we owe the pleasure?" the deep booming voice of Lord Tikka called out. His tone was warm and welcoming, much like his halls. Everywhere Tom glanced there were dragonettes, winter coats flung open to let the heat of the fires in. Some, more set on staying within the walls, wore clothes no thicker than what Tom knew the dragonettes of the keep to wear. With every step taken and moment within he could feel his body move more easily, and his mind clear. Which only raised his anxiety.

He could feel his heart pounding. Just getting here had been near fatal, or at least felt like it. And what was to come might be no easier.

"Thank you, sir. Our visit is nothing unusual I can assure you. We are simply… doing the rounds," Harvik replied as the lord got up from his seat, which looked more like a throne. Elevated, with gilding upon the wood where it could be seen, and covered in grand furs, which Tom had no idea what might be. Joelina glanced about the room at the many trophies lining the walls. Some looked wolf-like, or perhaps bear. Others were clearly draconic in nature, but they lacked horns. And two were far too small to be anything but a child by dragon standards. Surely they must be something else.

Pride of place given to three dragon skulls hanging behind the lord's seat. The center one must surely be as large as Arch. It was flanked by smaller ones, and they all had different horns and spines protruding from the bone.

"Naturally. I take it Chaika is hungry as ever? Shall we slaughter something for him perhaps?"

"I think it best we leave his dinner for the morn. He had a hearty breakfast," Harvik lied, or was it true? Joelina couldn't even remember. "Besides he will need it I believe. We depart come morning, weather permitting of course."

"Spares us a good ox," the lord replied in good humor, though the inquisitor's demeanor did not match it. He was cold, and calculating. He was working, and the lord likely knew so. "But a decent meal for you and your people is the least we can do."

"Quite so, quite so… But first I have a young one I must test. Joelina, do please put your talents to use."

Tom felt the woman stiffen before she took a step forward, almost mechanically, looking to the lord. She gave him a nod, eyes never leaving his. She stared him down, watching every twitch on his face. Confusion at first, but then a flicker of worry, soon replaced by his warm welcoming facade.

"Oh I see. What a delight. I take it you want to do my damndest to keep our secrets from her?"

"Nooo. I would not recommend that. Not unless I am to start instructing one of your sons in his duties," the inquisitor replied with a touch of a snicker. The lord took it well, like a good joke. He laughed in reply and even slapped his thighs as he sat back down upon his throne.

"Well then. You best not upset my wife? She will be watching from up above."

"I make no such promises," Joelina replied, stepping up, eyes starting to dart side to side, heart racing. There were less than half a dozen of them here. The rest were still with Chaika, in the middle of a fortress where they should feel safe… But they were vastly outnumbered if it came to it.

The lord waited patiently as she made her way up the steps to the raised platform upon which his throne sat, his attention shifting between her and the inquisitor behind her. Harvik had not moved, nor did any of the others. Save for Glazz. She remained to Joelina's left, but a step behind her.

"This will be quite uncomfortable, Lord Tikka," the young cadet clarified as she sat across his lap. He seemed surprised by the act. She knew she was a fine-looking woman. Even a touch of distraction made her job all the easier. 'Let your mind wander… yes, look away. Very good.'

She placed her hands on the sides of his skull, fingers pressed into the leathery skin. She closed her eyes and concentrated. She concentrated on that which lay beyond the grasp of her fingers. Tendrils of magic poking and prodding at another mind.

A shiver ran down her spine; it felt good. Tikka did not resist her. He welcomed her with memories, sweet delicious memories. Happy times. His childhood running around playing with kites before he could fly. Playing games in the snow only to quickly run back inside before his tail froze off. Stealing food from the pantry with some mischievous friends. It was all very idyllic. An impossibility for this part of the world.

"Very impressive. You have done this before. I did not come here for a puppet show, Lord Tikka," Joelina commanded. He could hear her, and what he was showing was of little interest. The lord changed tack, bringing forth memories of fighting against the biting cold. The howling wind, numb fingers and toes.

Terrifying beasts that had someone's heart pumping, though Tom knew not if it was his or hers. The memories were picked through and one stood out. For all the wrong reasons. When probed the lord resisted. He dared to resist her after letting her in the door? This warranted further investigation.

He writhed under her as she pushed. She pried the memory open against his will and he felt him shake and twist. "Do not resist, I will know all."

He grew still, limp almost. His mind but a whisper in response. "Of course." There was defeat and sadness in his tone. Tom could feel Joelina grow excited. She might have found something. With a rush, as if going weightless, Tom found himself immersed in the memory of a dragonette he had never even met. On a frozen sheet of ice, the wind howling around them.

It was grey, dim, and stormy. The icy wind bit at his snout, even covered as it was. He could make out sleds with strange four-legged creatures hauling, their gray muddled coat matched his own. Their fur was long and silky, and looked to be a double coat. He had seen it at the fortress too but seconds ago. They were the size of Shetland ponies perhaps, four to a sled, faces long and angular without any sign of ears. One turned to look back at him, its eyes black and beady, there were four of them in total, much like the Vargulfs he had been so acquainted with before.

He wanted to stare but could not, the lord's gaze instead turning to his comrades. In front of him another sled could be made out, behind him a third. Everyone was stopped. Everyone was quiet as could be. Then he turned to face the unknown, shrouded by dim light and a flurry of snow.

He could feel the warmth coming from within his thick suit. Either rocks or water bottles he assumed. They could not be far from shelter. He raised a spear, which looked a touch odd - it had rope tied to it, and a weird second stick actually held it.

"What is so special about this? What are you hiding?" Joelina questioned, receiving no response as through the stormy winds a rumbling was heard. A deep guttural rumble. Then from beyond the the snow came flying through the air a massive six legged, tailless creature. Its fur was long, white, and shaggy. Huge horns swept down by the sides of its neck, turning to face forward below the chin.

"Ferinix!" Tikka shouted out as he threw his spear and it hit its mark. But he was spared, the sled in front of him was the target. The massive multi-ton beast came down upon it with a shattering of wood and a quick scream cut short but a moment later. More spears were flung, ropes being let out as the creature carried on its bounding run, flinging itself into the night once more. A dragonette lodged betwixt its teeth.

"Jinka!" someone called out, the three other dragonettes with the forward sleigh setting off running after the beast. Tom felt the certainty of steel descend over his motions. He lept atop his sled, drawing a saber and severing the lines binding the "dogs" to the sled.

"Hold on tight!" he called out as he crouched low, arms grabbing hold of the wooden frame. He watched the rope uncoil before going taut. It was secured to the heavy sled. And with a yank, they set off into the darkness.

Faster and faster they went into the flurry of snow as the beast made its getaway. More spears were flung and a crossbow loosed against it. "Tire it out. Let the poison work!"

As soon as he made his call the massive creature turned side on, coming to a skidding stop, the sled sliding helplessly towards it. "Scatter!" the lord called, jumping from the sleigh as the Ferinix pounced once more, hurling itself at Tikka's sled. The lord staggered back, landing upon his back and watching as the dragonette steering from the rear was snatched up in a single bite. The scream cut painfully short with the crunch of bones.

"Tetraia!" the lord screamed, a pained, bloodcurdling scream, hand held high in front of him as he froze in place. The hulking creature turned to look at the source of the noise, a lifeless body of a woman hanging from its mouth. It remained staring for but a moment before another spear hit its mark, this one exploded upon impact into a flash of fire and heat. The creature startled back from the flash, its fur singed and smoldering before it charged the remaining sled, reducing it to kindling. It took a moment to gulp down its prey before bounding into the storm once more, a lone dragonette being dragged screaming after it tied to one of the spears.

"Tetraia…"

Tom felt the pain, the horror, the pure, unrelenting, crushing loss. He did not know who that woman might have been, but he knew who she was to Tikka.

"You hunted a Ferinix… That is a grave offence, Lord Tikka," The judging voice of Joelina rang out through the memory as Tom felt the ice cold of the snow, wind, and despair overtake him. "I trust you had a reason."

"It killed my oldest son. It hunted dragonettes right up against our keep… It could not be allowed to continue," the lord replied quietly, calmly, solemnly. "Please, it was the right thing to do."

"No… Though I believe the punishment fitting of the crime. Besides, you failed to fell the beast, did you not?"

"No… It succumbed to the poison. It sits mounted above you right now."

And with a rush in his stomach like the sensation of falling he returned to the warm pleasant hall, the sensation of loss and utter despair remaining within him. Though it hardly seemed to faze Joelina. She looked up to the massive dragon skull mounted to the wall in surprise. It was no dragon skull at all.

Behind her she heard a rumbling laugh, followed by a lone, slow, clapping.

"Very good. Well done, Joelina. You will do quite nicely indeed. Thank you, lord Tikka. As always you provide a great service."

The lord did not answer, instead simply glaring at the jovial Inquisitor Harvik. "Inquisitor?" Joelina questioned, clearly confused as to what was going on.

"Relax young one. That trophy is our little secret. Has been for some time… You will now keep it too. Well done. Not everyone managed to pick out his little secret. Least of all so swiftly. And without hesitation might I add."

"This was a test?"

"I do not believe in the training master of citadel. He is too soft. Come on, I believe there will be a feast soon. We have planning to do."

***

"So… you look tired," Saph commented as Jacky stepped into the workshop. The woman hadn't been there for breakfast, so something was definitely up.

Saph's job for the day was to help Fengi and Yldril, as the worksite had dried out enough that they were going to try and have Yldrill rebuild the foundations. To add to the day's labor, through some miracle Glira had taken the pudding the day before yesterday, agreeing to fetch some logs for them. That of course meant they needed to get the saw working, which looked like it may be easier said than done. Saph suspected she was perhaps still under the impression that hard work would impress Tom into giving what she overtly wanted. Saph was crossing her fingers that might make her work the saw once she made it back.

She probably wouldn't stand doing manual labor around Yldril because there was no way in even the deepest crevasse of hell that black dragon wouldn't rub Glira's snout in it. Saph didn't care though. They still got to brag about having gotten a royal guard dragon to fetch wood for them. Fengi thought it came down to said dragon not wanting to end up on the bad side of the inquisition. which was certainly also a possibility, even if Glira rarely had a problem with ending up on people's bad side. But whatever worked.

"I am tired… Tom had a shit night again," Jacky responded, for all the world looking like she hadn't gotten more than a half-night's sleep.

"Not again," Linkosta complained, looking up from her book which she had annoyingly placed on the worktable Saph was trying to use to organize the brackets she had been told to fetch. The mage had been pestering Saph ever since breakfast hoping she could get Fengi to change her mind on barring them from experimenting with Yldril.

Saph was not one for stabbing her friends in the back though. She understood what Fengi was trying to do. That and she also believed Yldril would mess up sooner or later so all parties could get what they wanted. Jacky's position was far more interesting, and important.

"How bad?" Saph questioned, hoping that the news would at least not be catastrophic.

"Don't know," Jacky let out, exasperated. "He muttered in his sleep. He tried to throw something and then the shouting began… Something about a Tetraia. He won't say who that was. He's like super depressed about it."

"Then why are you down here? Go stay with him," Wiperna questioned, rightfully confused.

"To ask a favor… Lin, would you mind?" Jackalope questioned, turning to the mage.

"Mind what? You need me to help with something? I do not think I can make the symptoms any less prevalent. We have already tried that."

"Noo…  not that. He wants to know about a big dragon like snow monster. Would you mind? I haven't heard of something like that before. Maybe find him something else to read too? Something that can take his mind off this one."

"Oh of course, I can bring this," the mage declared, triumphantly holding up the book of draconic sorcery. "It contains some speculation on the origins of dragons. Maybe he is talking about a Ferinix."

"Oh yeah, I think he said something like that…Yeah very good… just something other than that too… Oh who am I kidding? Yeah, just take that one. He won't wanna hear anything else. He wants to work out what he saw, for sure."

'It's rare, but thank fuck for Jacky,' Saph went to herself as Linkosta started packing up her things. She had wanted to snap at the mage for continuing to pester her about Fengi.

"Wip, I know I'm being an arse, but could you like… keep working on the… thing?" Jacky continued, looking at the farm woman who had been grinding away on an axehead in the corner. They would need them sharp for the work to come after all, so nothing strange there.

"Don't worry about it Jacky, of course. Just remember to get the last few measurements, okay?" the farmer replied to Saph's surprise.

"What thing?"

Jacky looked a little hesitant, glancing between Saph and Linkosta before sighing. "Okay don't tell anyone, but I'm getting some clothes made for Tom. He needs something nice, you know… something that's from here. Even if the T-shirts are quite nice."

"I still don't get why you haven't grabbed one of those yet. I can't imagine he would mind," Wiperna replied, shaking her head gently as she started to pedal on the grind wheel once more.

"Oh yeah… I'm so doing that," the only half-awake Jacky replied, though it did seem to wake her up a little.

"So that's what you have been cooking up. I was wondering what all that leather would turn into in the end."

"Yeaaaah… I wanted to do most of it myself, but well… I'm not that great at sewing and well… Everything."

"Won't' tell a soul, promise. What are you making for him?"

"Shirt, pants, coat… maybe something to wrap around his neck… he hasn't got much of a neck though."

"He is going to love the coat. We got some nice fox fur for that one after your last go," Wiperna joined in, her voice kind and caring.

"Yeah, but I feel like wolf or something would have been better. But we haven't seen any this year… like at all."

"Fox is very soft, I don't think he needs something as warm as wolf. You're just doing trimmings, right?" Saph questioned, really hoping the answer was yes. A patchwork of foxes would not look very good at all.

"Of course," Wiperna replied merrily before Jacky got a word out. "It will mostly be leather. I was thinking perhaps with some sort of fur lining if we could scrape it together. Deer or Boar isn't much good after all.

"But for now, plain leather. Just something for everyday, you know?" Jacky interrupted, clearly wanted to say a word too. "His stuff won't last forever, amazing as it is. Might also make him look a little less ridiculous if we get any new guests in the future."

"That would be nice, yeah… even if it was quite fun to do up his hair."

"I'm sure he'll love it much more than he did the hair," the farm woman reassured her. "The lightning bolt is pretty much gone now too."

"Maybe he needs another trimming then," Saph snickered. "But I'm sure he'll love the clothes." She wholeheartedly believed that fact. In fact, she was quite certain Jacky could give Tom a shiny rock and he would love it. Tailored clothes? Not even a question in her mind.

"Oh also, don't forget the dragon skull. Surely that has to be about done by now."

"Oh yeah… thanks," Jacky replied, gesturing for Linkosta to follow her. "Come on Lin, I make no promises about not falling asleep. And I am the one cuddling him… you are like… storyteller. Like Apuma when we were little."

"Oki doki," the mage responded, unfazed, following the slow-moving Jacky out of the workshop, leaving Saph and Wiperna staring at each other.

"Soooo, think I can help you instead of having to hammer in nails all day?"

"I think I will be fine," Wiperna replied with a knowing smile on her face as she held out the axe. "Axe is sharp though. If you hurry you might be done in time to get to see what I've been working on. It's turning out great."

"Hang on, weren't you supposed to be the one doing the joinery? I don't know how to do that?!"

"No, Kullinger is. You're just helping him."

"Aw fuuuuu."

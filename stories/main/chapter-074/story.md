It would appear that the interesting part of the meeting had passed, as they were currently discussing lowering taxation on animal husbandry to encourage more people to take to the countryside outside the capital. Nunuk had responded that she would have Jarix along with a few others on the wing by tomorrow morning. They had been thanked for their service by the king himself, in front of the entire council for it, not to mention they were getting paid too. That was not something Sapphire ever thought was going to happen in her life.

'Hired by the king,' she thought to herself. Sure, they had likely saved him a great deal of money on messengers, but still, that was something not many could claim.

Now, though, she was quickly losing respect for the council, as she was now observing them bickering like children. It would seem they were almost equally concerned with tax rates as the city's security. At least it was clear they would be allowed to leave when they made it to recess. She wondered if they would be allowed to walk about the gardens for a bit, taking in the sights.

In here there were still plenty of things to look at, to pass the time. The ceiling was all one large painting, she guessed depicting the founding of the city or something, she didn't know. It was very pretty to look at though. The walls were also covered in more conventional paintings of what were likely important people. Not that she recognized anyone. Apuma's books had been rather light on pictures so it was mostly descriptions after all.

Perhaps she should buy a painting for her bedroom. Maybe she could even get one made of herself… no that would be a bit too egotistical. A nice scenery perhaps… she had that out the window though. Perhaps some pretty buildings then; the palace would do nicely. There was a very beautiful painting of the city seen from above hanging on the wall behind the king. Something like that would be awesome.

"Very good, the rate shall be reduced to one-fifth of yearly production from the previous one-fourth. Thirty-two votes to twenty-one. We will reconvene following a short recess," The speaker finally went. As people began to get up and move about, the usher who had shown them their seats, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, to escort them back out. Sapphire was honestly surprised by the little guy's stealth, even if she had been rather distracted at the moment.

As they walked back out admiring the paintings, she wondered what would happen if Tom showed these people a picture. She grinned a bit to herself at that. She was in the wealthiest place she knew of and she had something that no one, not even the king, had. She had been photographed.

Another finely dressed individual had come up to them on their way out carrying the formal invitations to the academy. They apparently still had to book an appointment. Dakota had taken the documents politely nodding though seeming confused. 'Oh fuck the trance thing' Sapphire cursed herself. They had forgotten to tell her that. Sapphire leaned in to whisper.

"Don't worry about it we'll tell you about it later" Dakota just nodded looking a bit perplexed, pocketing the paperwork.

The guards they were assigned to as soon as they left the building were apparently used to people like them, and graciously allowed all the frontier dragonettes to have a walk about the gardens. Escorted at all times, obviously. It was strange to see what was so undeniably nature bent to someone's will like this. Bushes cut into exact shapes. Lawns of closely cut grass and beds of flowers she had never seen before mixed with some they likely had growing up the walls back home.

Not to mention, they were currently the center of attention for pretty much everyone. Even the royal guards escorting them seemed interested. Sapphire couldn't help but puff out her chest a little. Following that report, she assumed they could say just about everything they wanted about short of where he was actually from and all his things. Being the center of attention in a place like this was a rather surreal experience.

"Not to pry or anything, but what does he do when not killing everything around him?"

"He watches the children and works like a mad man. Honestly, you should see him in the fields, it's amazing," Sapphire responded in a cordial tone. They did need to put on a good facade after all. It wouldn't do to be rude or seem too superior around here.

"What does he eat? Is it strange?" another asked, sounding a tad worried, yet curious.

"Vegetables mostly, he does like hog though," Balethon went. Well, it was only fair the three of them shared the attention. Dakota didn't usually like that though so it did leave more for Sapphire and Balethon.

"Is he like some dumb creature that defends the children then?" "Oh, like a pet?" The questions came from a male and female dragonette Sapphire didn't know. She sighed a bit at that.

"No, if anything he's smarter than us I think," she replied, trying not to be disrespectful. "And if he heard you say that, I doubt he would be pleased."

"He certainly put us to shame with mathematics," Dakota added.

"He talks?... Like actual Draconic?"

"Sure, still has a funny accent though," Balethon replied. That was true he could sound rather strange at times. Not to mention his throat did seem to get sore after talking too much every now and again.

"Look in the fountain, you can see the bottom," Someone then went excitedly. Sapphire had to give him it was definitely a lot different than the lake water they had back home. It was almost the same shade of light blue as the scales running down her chest in fact. "Almost like the swimming hall Tom was talking about," Baleethon went, looking into the shimmering pool.

"Wait, he can swim!?"

"Oh yeah, he loves it," Dakota replied, a sour twinge to her tone.

"You said he didn't have wings. Do you carry him around all the time then?"

"Sometimes, he mostly stays at the keep though," Sapphire replied. "Not to mention Jarix has taken a liking to him as well. That's the young dragon that has been stationed with us," She clarified, trying her best not to sound too smug.

"Do you think he could kill a dragon?"

"Either that or he dies trying," Balethon answered with a shrug. "The dude just doesn't run"

"I wonder what a city where no one flies looks like?"

"I don't think you could get anywhere. They must live in little communities that don't see each other."

'Oh, if they only knew how wrong they were,' Sapphire thought to herself, content to let the other frontier folk discuss with each other on that one.

"If it's cold all the time, they might just use the snow to build or live under it? Perhaps underground entirely?"

"I think they would live in caves."

The three of them just looked at each other with amused expressions on their face. They weren't gonna comment on that.

"You leave at first light tomorrow morning and that's final," Rachuck stated, looking at the rather ragged-looking hunting party. "This is by order of the king!"

Zarko and Radexi were standing at attention looking like soldiers at inspection. Tom though was wondering just why the fuck timing had to be such a bitch.

"Get some rest Jackalope, we will need you. The rest of you get that thing sorted in a hurry, we need to prepare."

"Sir, yes, sir!"

Rachuck set off at an official-looking fast jog, causing Tom to wonder whether this had all gone to his head a bit. It sounded mighty important though, "by order of the king." He wondered just what the fuck Sapphire and the others had been up to since they were taking orders from the king. They couldn't have been there for more than a day or two yet.

Predictably, Jarix was beside himself with excitement, which did help with his work ethic, despite clearly being tired from the flight. With the big guy's help they got the tirox strung up to gut it in no time. Following that, Jarix had gone back up to the greeting hall to start going over his equipment.

Tom and Fengi set to work preparing the massive beast. They ended up having to cut it into smaller pieces just to get it onto the curing racks where it would need to sit for a few days. Jackalope had taken the order to get some rest as an excuse to watch the two of them as they worked. Predictably that didn't last long, before she decided Tom wasn't doing it right coming over to start demonstrating how to do it properly.

"You go right in against the bone here, remember to drag the blade, don't push it. Now try again." Tom did his best to try and imitate the movements she had been making. She just made it seem so easy though, not to mention her longer blade did help out quite a bit, compared to his much shorter hunting knife, when working on something this size.

Jackalope apparently agreed, flipping her knife handing him her long sleek blade hilt first, with an encouraging head tilt. Tom wiped and holstered his own blade, taking the knife. It was lighter than he had thought, all the huntresses carried them, Jackalope's didn't seem any different. He hadn't actually held one before though.

He tried again with the longer blade. It was a lot easier to get into the nooks and crannies with it, even if it definitely took some getting used to.

"No, no, like this," Jackalope went, grabbing his hand standing behind him as she began to guide him through it. Tom could hear Fengi snickering. He didn't mind, this was definitely something he could get used to.

"How long have you been a huntress, Jacky?"

"Well I was coppered when I was 16, but I've been helping out since I was around 10," She replied, sounding more like she was concentrating on the work at hand.

"No wonder you're good at this then." She did stop for a second at that, giving him a nudge with her snout, before continuing.

Quite a few of the others came down to see the massive catch, earning them a fair amount of praise. Eventually, Jackalope let go, standing back to watch him work. Tom was wondering how best to break the news of him and Jackalope, or if he even should. When an overloaded Kokashi landed carrying Esmeralda. She immediately got off, walking over to them arms outstretched.

"Oh my gods, Jacky! That's amazing!" Jackalope looked more like a deer caught in the headlights than somebody happy to see Esmeralda, as the older dragonette hugged her. "I must say. You've gotten braver, or did he ask you?" Tom and Jackalope just glanced at Fengi who was looking very proud of herself. "Fengi! That's not nice."

'Goddammit,' Tom thought to himself, unsure who was to blame for this. Kokashi's damn hearing was likely involved though.

"Oh come on," Fengi replied dismissively. "It's perfect."

"Wait, what's going on?" Wiperna asked from where she was admiring the horns of the tirox. All the eyes around them turned to Jackalope, looking for answers. Some glancing at Tom curiously.

As Esmeralda let go of Jackalope she appeared to regain her composure, standing tall raising her head again. "I asked Tom if he liked me and he said 'yes,' of course."

"Oh this should be good," Herron added in an amused tone, as most of the people present just went quiet, looking at the two of them. Then Nunuk landed, looking very angry.

"Esmeralda! You are not supposed to be out of bed yet, what are you doing down here?"

"We have a pair of spring lovers on our hands!" Esmeralda replied excitedly, completely ignoring Nunuk's protest.

It took Nunuk a second before she noticed Tom holding Jackalope's knife. "Oh no... Don't tell me." Nunuk went, with a slightly horrified expression.

"Yup," Fengi replied, still sounding proud of herself.

"Why of all times did you choose now for that?!" Nunuk exclaimed, seemingly ready to claw at her own face. "For all we know we might be going to war tomorrow and you… The gods give me strength." Jackalope looked about ready to reply when she was cut off by Wiperna.

"Has anyone told Shiva?" She sounded slightly worried, to Tom. He gulped a bit at that notion, were you supposed to do that here? He really didn't fancy the prospect of pissing off the two-meter tall bundle of muscle with more hammers than he had candies. Even if he might have Jackalope to hide behind.

"Oh, go fetch her would you hubby?" Esmeralda went, still sounding extremely excited. Kokashi diligently obliged, taking to the wing in a hurry.

"No, wait not like… this," Jackalope went in vain as Kokashi took off.

"You know you can't keep this a secret from her, right? Besides I'm sure she has already figured it out." Fengi tried to reassure the distraught Jackalope.

The "WHAT!" that rang out from above them, would seem to suggest otherwise. Both Tom and Jackalope instinctively recoiled a bit at the exclamation. It didn't take long before the large frame of Shiva came diving down from the lower platform leading to the armory.

She touched down hard, eyes flicking between the two of them without saying a word. Finally settling on Jackalope.

"What did you agree to?" She asked in a cold tone looking at her daughter. It was clear Jackalope was terrified of answering that question, though she did eventually rank her back, replying.

"I just asked if he liked me and he said 'yes.' Didn't agree to nothing." Her usual confidence was still there, even if there were clear cracks showing.

"I believe the word used was 'I love you,' " Fengi added looking at Tom. He was fairly sure he was red as a tomato right now. At that Shiva turned to look at Tom, raising a finger.

"If you are lying to her."

"You'll break me, I got it, nooo worries," Tom responded trying his best to match Jackalope's confidence.

"No," She went leaning forward sneering, until she was nearly touching his face, "I will fry you in butter and make a feast out of your ass and then chuck the remnants into the depths of hell itself." Okay, Tom was officially scared right now. Her voice was calm yet incredibly threatening. To his surprise he found Jackalope interposing herself, pushing him a step back.

"You won't touch him less I say so!" Shiva's gaze seemed to switch between the two of them a few times before taking a step back, straightening back up to her full height.

"Just making sure he knows." She replied, voice not much warmer.

"Do try to be nice Shiva." Nunuk went, to Tom's surprise. The lady hadn't exactly seemed pleased by this development after all. "We don't have time for sentimentality or fighting right now. We all have work to do. Including you two," She went turning to Tom and Jackalope. "So get finished up down here, we're planning after dinner and you need to stay in your bed," Nunuk chided pointing at Esmeralda.

"Fine... thanks for the movie by the way, it was great." Esmeralda replied looking to Tom. Wiperna gave her a lift back up, to Kokashi's evident relief as he took off after them. Shiva also eventually backed off, after having stared at the two of them for a while longer, going back to her work.

"I will be watching," she declared as she herself took off.

"That… could have been worse," Tom eventually went, looking to Jackalope.

"If you say so." Jackalope replied, clearly not agreeing entirely with him.

"Well, how were we supposed to know about those other keeps?" Fengi replied. "I think today has gone very well all things considered."

They had finished up the tirox as quickly as they could, Tom doing his best to keep up with Fengi as they worked. She was pretty handy with a knife too after all. Jackalope did lend a hand with some of the lifting work but other than that she continued watching him, correcting where necessary.

They got it all finished in time for dinner and Tom handed back the knife.

"You're gonna need one of these if you want to shoot more tirox, that's for sure," Jackalope stated as she holstered the knife.

"I say that's division of labor, I kill it you cut it up," Jackalope didn't seem too impressed by that as she crossed her arms, there was still a smile on her face though.

"And carry you home, and out there and race a dragon while doing so, I think I did all the work today."

"Is that so?" Tom replied, bending down, putting his shoulder against her stomach, and lifting her off her feet.

"What the… hey I can walk you know?" Tom ignored her halfhearted protest. Looking to Fengi with a grin.

"See you up there Fen."

"See ya," Fengi replied merely.

Jackalope was quite a bit heavier than Sapphire, but Tom didn't have his weights on though so it was not too bad. Back home she might actually be around a hundred kilos with all that muscle and clocking in at around 195cm, not counting the horns. Here, though, no problem.

"You think they will let us both go with Jarix tomorrow?" Jackalope questioned as they were making their way up the stairs.

"I hope so. I need to keep an eye on our young recruit."

"He's older than us both combined isn't he?" Jackalope questioned, sounding slightly confused.

"Maybe, he still has a lot to learn though."

"Do I need to as well?"

"Yeah, at some point probably."

"Please don't get started with all that math stuff," She did sound genuinely concerned. Tom just chuckled a bit at that.

"No, not math, I think you need to learn gun safety first of all. We don't want a repeat of last time now do we?"

"Sorry… I just wanted to try."

"Hey, I clearly ain't mad, am I?"

"I guess not… you are slow though, move it!" she went smacking him on the arse.

"Oh you want speed do you?" He replied, picking up the pace, making sure not to spare her from the jolting motion as he went up the stairs. She did make some very funny-sounding noises as his shoulder dug into her stomach with each stride. She didn't protest though. At least not until they made it up into the keep.

"Okay you can put me down now my steed," Tom obliged, setting her down gently.

"Well all that carrying has me hungry, what about you?"

"Starving, let's go see if dinner is ready."

The two of them had taken seats next to each other at the huntresses table, rather than the usual arrangement of Tom sitting with the kids. That role was currently in the hands of Wiperna. Most of the guards had come by to congratulate them, or poke fun at them. It varied. The atmosphere was weird though, everyone felt on edge. Tom put it down to what they were supposed to be doing tomorrow, rather than him and Jackalope. Even if he had to admit that was a possible factor.

Unkai had seemed anxious to Tom, perhaps he was wondering just what the fuck had happened today. Tom couldn't blame him, he hardly knew himself, really. He would need some alone time with the guard at some point, he guessed they could both need some advice after all.

Jackalope had wolfed down her dinner, clearly not having lied about starving. He wondered if that had something to do with the sugar or just with how hard she had been working today. She did eat well most days, but this was abnormal even for her, she even matched him. The day's course was a nice rich deer stew. As he poked at the side of beans he reminisced a bit about home. He did miss potatoes and pasta after all. The potatoes were on the way, but perhaps he should try to make pasta at some point. 'No, Tom, there is a war brewing, you just said 'I love you' to a girl who loves explosions, and you are trying to start the industrial revolution while teaching a flying gun about life. Pasta can wait.'

"You're never quiet. Something wrong?" Jackalope questioned. Looking at him, as she licked the stew away from her face.

"Nah, everything's fine. Just a lot to worry about."

"I know right. They are totally gonna eat the best steaks while we're gone," Tom chuckled a bit at that. Perhaps he was in need of a Jackalope lesson after all.

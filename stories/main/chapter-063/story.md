"Where is she!?" Unkai went as he rounded the corner at a flat sprint.

"Here you dingus!" Sapphire shouted at him. For the gods sake, they were in the middle of the room kneeling over Esmeralda.

He ran over as quickly as he could coming to a sliding halt. Not a bad looking maneuver in fact.

"Right what have we got?"

"She stabbed her in the gut" Sapphire stated matter of factly.

"I see, out you come." The small dagger clanked to the floor as Unkai set about stopping the bleeding.

"Don't worry you'll live, gonna need to do this properly at some point though."

"Properly?!" Esmeralda replied worriedly.

"Shhh, now, lay still otherwise this will end up looking weird." At that Esmeralda laid perfectly still. There were cool scars and hideous scars. The latter was best avoided after all.

Tyborg handed Sapphire the blade. It was a nicely made piece, finely decorated, even a bit of gold trimming. "You expect this to kill a huntress?" She spat at the Lady who was currently being pinned down and in the process of being bound, to much protest from her three companions who had decided now was the right time to join in the discussion.

They clearly thought some kind of injustice was being committed restraining someone for attempted murder. After Kolinky made it very clear that attempting to get in his way right now would be a very unhealthy idea, they resorted to just standing well clear, making accusations and threats.

The lady though appeared to have calmed down, she didn't even answer Sapphire, instead just looking at her with a fiendish grin on her face. Sapphire looked down to the dagger. It was covered in blood but the blade itself was rather unremarkable. She held it up and sniffed it. All she got was the blood of her friend, so she licked it with just the tip of her forked tongue.

"It's poison!" She screamed, spitting out foul concoction. "Clean it, clean it!"

"Sorry, this is gonna hurt" Ukai went before he cut the wound back open. "I need water now!" Several bottles and skins were quickly produced as they went about rinsing the wound as best they could. Sapphire just sat down beside Esmeralda to hold her hand.

"What the hell is going on?!" Shiva went, as she and Jackalope rounded the corner. "She stabbed Esmeralda with a poisoned dagger"

"What!" Jackalope replied head snapping to the lady, making for her at a flat sprint. Shoulder checking Latori off her and grabbing her by the shoulders. She pounded her into the floor "What did you use?! What did you use?!"

It took a bit before Jackalope stopped shaking her enough to let her speak. "Green dragon venom of course"

"I'll get the old man, he'll know right?"Jackalope went, getting up looking around in a panic. "Now where is he?"

"What is going on down here?" Apuma went rounding the corner with a gaggle of kids on his heels.

"Oh, my word Essy." He went, clearly not understanding the gravity of the situation.

"Antidote for green dragon venom now!" Jackalope roared at him.

His face almost went as white as the kids behind him as he turned to run back the way he came. "Hurry, hurry out of the way!" Jackalope running after him.

"Did that bitch really manage to kill me?" Esmeralda asked Sapphire clutching her hand.

"No of course not, you're staying right here, don't you worry."

"That's as clean as I can get it" Unkai went, beginning to close the wound back up.

"Will that be good enough?" Tyborg questioned.

"You tell me, I have no clue how much you need to kill" Unkai replied in a disheartened tone.

"Where is Nunuk when you need her?" Sapphire sighed despairingly. Unkai looked a bit ashamed at that comment, but it was the truth, she would know. Sapphire just hoped Apuma did too. At least it wasn't Dakota who had been around, Sapphire doubted she could bear not being able to do more.

Tom was feeling rather pleased with himself. They had secured a dragon for the keep, and convinced him to actually help out around here, they would be receiving a shipment of both raw materials, tools, and other spare parts from the capitol signed for by Hashaw. Even if the box said it was for Jarix. They also had two new hands to help out around the keep with everyday stuff, and with Jarix helping on the hunts they didn't even need the quad bike to haul things back and forth long-distance.

Hashaw had also agreed to drop these ridiculous charges against them if the Lady hadn't somehow managed to dig something up while they were gone. They would be departing tomorrow or possibly the day after that and they were taking the bitch with them. All in all a very productive start to the day.

The scene that greeted them as Jarix came into land though was an odd one though. Dragonettes were everywhere, some running back and forth Esmeralda was lying down and Layd Flaxen was also on the ground though she had two royal guards on her back keeping her down.

"What the hell?" Jarix went in confusion as he struggled to find a place to land without squashing someone. Archeon ended up veering off to land on the ground along with Baron, his passengers disembarking mid-flight.

The landing was less than gracious but they were down safe and sound. The same could not be said for Esmeralda. Tom had half fallen off Jarix doing a not so gracious stumble running over. Sapphire quickly explained the situation. A poisoned dagger what the fuck! How does one even treat that?

"Where is Apuma?!" Nunuk shouted as she touched down.

"Already on it" Came the reply. Well, that was something at least.

"You got something, Tom?" Nunuk questioned turning to him.

"What kinda poison?"

"Green dragon," Sapphire replied. That didn't sound good to Tom.

"Oh shit" Nunuk replied, turning away from Tom. That really didn't help his confidence.

Jarix turned away slinging his head over the side"Green dragon poison antidote we got any!?" He roared down towards Baron.

"Whatâ€¦ Why?" Baron questioned voice carrying clearly

"Just get It up here NOW!" Jarix replied, turning back, closing the argument.

Tom just stood there not sure what to do. He had never had to deal with poison before, apart from like, bee stings, or jellyfish. Those were annoying, not fatal though. Dakota and Nunuk had made their way to Esmeralda clearly doing what they could.

What to do, what to do? He couldn't just look up how to treat dragon poison in anything other than a dnd book. The stuff might even be magical. Wait... if Jarix asked for an antidote there must be one. No way that bitch was brave enough not to have some then.

"Only a coward uses poison and cowards have a backup plan. Where is your antidote!?" He went kneeling down in front of her leveling the gun at her head.

"Haven't got one, not anymore" She just replied with a sly smile.

"That little flask, you monster! You planned this!" Sapphire screamed out, clearly having heard what they were talking about. Oh, Fuck all kinds of duck.

"No one talks to me like that and lives" The bitch spat back at Sapphire.

"What is wrong with Essy?" Holdey asked, walking over, some of the escorts quick to shoo him away. they didn't need to see this.

"Lady Flaxen, you just attempted to murder a close friend who I am by an oath sworn to defend. If she dies you die." Tom stated as coldly as his rising temper would allow, pushing the revolver against her forehead cocking the hammer.

"I am a noble, you vile creature. Touch,  me and you're dead!"

"I highly fucking doubt that. You're less noble than a street rat, so let me make it very clear for you. I will fucking murder you, mount your head as a trophy above my door, cut you into little pieces and send you to the corners of this world, so your family may spend a lifetime trying to find enough of you to have a burial!" Tom had more than had it with this piece of shit. It would seem the lady barely even registered that threat, Kolinky and Latori both stiffened up though.

"Look around you, they will burn this keep to the ground if that happens."

"You people have called me many things, terror in the night, master of death, legendary warrior, and a god of war. Believe me when I tell you I don't give a shit who you are and if I say so you die! Along with anyone dumb enough to stand beside you. Kolinky are you dumb enough to die defending a murderer?"

"Nope, she's all yours" He replied sounding like he was trying to hide a shiver. It would seem that the message even made it through that thick skull of hers as the smile finally faded.

Tom got back up looking to Esmeralda. They were keeping her lying down and as calm as they could manage. The poison was likely well spread through her system already, but it might help a bit. She was also turning a sickly shade of green. It was slow, but around the ears, neck, and between her fingers, there was no mistaking it. It looked like she was rotting in front of them.

Unkai had brought some foul-smelling concoction, which they were force-feeding her. Kokashi had also arrived. Taking Sapphire's place by his wife's side, doing his best to comfort her. It was a miserable spectacle. Not again Tom thought, why did it have to be like this again?

And he was just standing there like an idiot making threats at the stupid bitch. He could just shoot her and be done with it. Sure there might be consequences but who the fuck cared right now. He had been doing well with his teaching though, might as well have another lesson.

"Get her on her feet" He went. The two guards actually obeyed which was nice. Grabbing her by the shoulders getting the bitch to her feet. Arms, legs, and wings all tied up.

"Would you mind making her look at what she has done? You know like training a stupid kid not to do something."

The two royal guards looked to each other before nodding and bringing her over.

"You need a lesson in responsibility and consequences. Look at her! Look at what you did!" The lady gave a quick glance then looked back to Tom.

"Oh no... she must be unwell, someone should help her." She taunted them.

Tom pulled an uppercut from the floor sending his armored gauntlet up into her jaw with a cracking sound. The hit left her dazed and clearly struggling to get her bearings as she swayed. If she wasn't being held up by the shoulders Tom guessed that would have put her on her arse. Then he grabbed one of her horns and turned her to look at Esmeralda again.

"I said look at her! Not glance" It took awhile for the bitch to get back to her senses following what might have been the first proper hit to the face she could remember.

"She's dying, so what? So did Dashu."

"That is a mother of two used to be three, then your piece of shit traitor of cousin came by. On that note." Tom turned her head to look at him then headbutted her, helmet first, in the mouth as she opened it to speak. The bitch screamed but Tom got what he wanted as it knocked a canine loose. "There we go, matching set." He went pocketing the tooth.

"What the fuck was that!" Hashaw demanded, coming in for a running landing. Not pleased by what she was seeing.

"I take a tooth from each murderer who comes to this keep" Hashaw glanced around quickly, her eyes landing on Esmeralda.

"You gotta be kidding me! Make room coming through." The colonel borderline kicked some of the escorts out of the way who were too slow on their feet. Setting down next to Esmeralda opening a leather pouch she had slung over her shoulder, looking through the contents.

"Black scyther, drake bane, no, no, not god tears, there we goâ€¦" She produced a tiny corked vial of clear liquid "Drink Huntress, for the love of the gods drink."

***

They actually had an antidote. Oh, those magnificent bastards. Sapphire had stepped back to make room for the ones who actually knew what they were doing and Kokashi of course. She had only heard of what green dragon poison did to someone, actually seeing it was a horrifying experience. Esmeralda was practically light green by now and her breathing was slow and labored. She had stopped talking and she didn't even seem to be looking at anything anymore.

They had to massage her throat to get the antidote down her throat. Then the waiting game began. Esmeralda had sputtered and was making noises. She also began thrashing about, so it was clearly doing something. Though Sapphire wasn't sure it was all good. Looking around she was clearly not alone in her worries.

Sapphire knew that the antidote could save Esmeralda's life, but she had no clue if they had made it in time. It hadn't been more than a few minutes since she was stabbed yet there was no mistaking this was gonna be a close call. The concoction Apuma had whipped together was apparently supposed to give her more time. So for the second time In the last long while, she sat down to give a prayer. Pleading that they had been fast enough and for Ishan not to take her friend yet. There was no way Letho was gonna be getting Esmeralda's soul, but surely Ishan could wait a little longer for its just dues.

Rachuck had suggested getting her kids, so they could say farewell to their mother. Kokashi had begged him not to, clearly holding back tears. It just wasn't fair that it was them again. First Anastasi and now this. Esmeralda couldn't even talk so it wouldn't have been much of a goodby anyway. Sapphire just sat down with her eyes closed focusing on her prayer. She felt someone sit down on either side of her, beginning to mutter as well.

She could hear Tom continuing to force Lady Flaxen to watch, having made it abundantly clear that if Esmeralda didn't make it neither would she. Hashaw might have something to say on that front, but Sapphire guessed there would be two bodies before the colonel got the chance to intervene.

The sound of an armored gauntlet striking home could be heard with even intervals. Breaking the uncomfortable noises Esmeralda was making and the complaining screaming coming from Lady Flaxen. Sapphire added a plea to bar the skies of heaven should the Lady somehow find her way up there.

As the sounds died down around her, it felt like the whole room was holding its breath only the murmuring of those in prayer could be heard alongside the struggling huntress for whom they were praying. The Lady even learned her lesson or was possibly unable to struggle anymore.

Sapphire didn't know how much time passed, but it was an uncomfortably long wait. She just repeated her prayer again and again. This was a mother she wasn't done down here yet, she was a friend too and one who would be sorely missed. With time the sputtering was replaced with coughing and wheezing. Sapphire just kept praying, not sure if that was good or bad.

"Looks like you can put that away" Nunuk finally broke the silence. Sapphire dared to open her eyes to see a completely still Esmeralda, except for her chest moving up and down with slow breaths.

"That's good right?" Fengi cautiously asked.

"She'll live, yes," Hashaw clarified. "Tom would you please take the gun out of the lady's mouth."

Tom obliged, stepping back to give the others some room, as Kolinky and Latori dragged the lady away. It was clear Tom had been less than gentle with her face.

"Let her rest for now, then move her to the infirmary. I'm going to see if Apuma has anything that will help further. Don't kill her yet." Nunuk went, holding up an authoritarian finger, pointing to the lady. That would be damn hard not to do Sapphire thought to herself as she got up to see how Esmeralda was doing. The green was fading slowly and she was breathing steadily. It was clear this had not been an easy trip though.

Rakshaza and Vigon had been allowed to come over. Esmeralda weakly holding each of their hands, as she struggled to speak. At Hashaw's instance, she relented. Instead, just weakly stroking each of them across the snout a bit.

"Don't worry, mother is okay" Kokashi tried as the horrified kids started crying. "She's gonna be just fine. The kind colonel helped her very much."

"No, I did not," Hashaw replied, getting up. "You two! How in the name of all that is holy! Did you manage to let a weakling of a noble get away with stabbing someone? With a poisoned dagger!"

Kolinky snapped to attention and started explaining rapidly "Esmeralda managed to grievously insult the lady, then lady Flaxen proceeded to try and fistfight a huntress. We just kinda let her. Esmeralda was even laughing at how useless she was. Thenâ€¦ that happened." He pointed to the knife currently in Dakota's hands. Sapphire didn't disagree with him. It had been hilarious to watch just how hopeless the lady was. Hard to find the situation funny now though.

Hashaw rubbed her temples with her off-hand right one firmly placed on the pommel of her sword. "You mean to tell me you let her attack and didn't even try! To stop herâ€¦ Give me strength."

Koliky was well statured, tall, and muscular for a man. Right now though, he more closely resembled Apuma hunched over and head held very low. Latori didn't seem to be affected in the slightest though.

"Honor duels aren't that uncommon, the lady's honor was insulted and she saw fit to defend it. The use of underhanded tricks aside., she was technically allowed to do that especially towards a non-noble. It was a considerable insult after all"

"Do please elaborate on this magic insult she came up with," Hashaw continued in a pained tone.

"Well, Esmeralda appears to believe the Lady had very intimate relations with the young Dashu. Which led to why she is soâ€¦ convinced, that those who condemned him should be prosecuted."

"What?" Hashaw replied clearly not quite grasping the implications. So Sapphire endeavored to elaborate.

"She's an incestuous bitch colonel and that is all there is to it. This doesn't even concern family honor, 'cause they haven't got any."

"You sniveling littleâ€¦" The colonel ended the Lady's emergent rant taking a page out of Tom's book backhanding her with her gauntleted hand. "Shut up unless spoken to! Well, that certainly explains a few thingsâ€¦ You got proof?" Oh yeah, we do, Sapphire thought to herself.

"Well, she felt the need to lie about where Dashu's sword was from, claiming it was a gift from his father. Which we have discovered definitely isn't the case as Dashu claimed it was a gift from his extended family and refused to answer questions about it. Then there was her reactionâ€¦ not exactly calm, is it? Nor does the excuse of protecting her family's honor line make sense when her behavior the last two days is taken into account." Hashaw looked at the Lady who was just about able to stand on her feet again, at this point.

"Lady Flaxen you are under arrest for attempted murder. Additionally, you are hereby charged with lying in front of a royal court, fabrication evidence to insinuate traitorous behavior, misleading and lying to members of the royal guard in the field, and breaking the rule of hospitality to the most extreme extent I have ever seen. While in my care!" Hashaw sounded furious, especially at that last point. This was not just a terrible stain on the Lady's honor but hers as well. "How do you plead?" The lady just looked at Hashaw with a contemptuous gaze not saying a word.

"Very well, as stated you are under arrest as are your compatriots. Tie them up" Hashaw went gesturing with her hand at the remaining robed dragonets. They looked like they didn't have a clue what was going on. "Lady Nunu... Dakota Bizmati. I would like to take Lady Flaxen before the royal court to which she lied. Is that agreeable to you?"

"Most definitely, do you require testimony?" Dakota responded with poorly restrained fury in her voice. Sapphire would have preferred they gave her a fitting send-off immediately.

"That would be greatly appreciated." The colonel responded. "Vulzan would your route happen to take you back to the capitol?"

"Uhmâ€¦ no" The trader responded seemingly unsure.

"Are you sure?"

"Come on Vulzi, they want you to testify as well and Tyborg saw the whole thing didn't you?" Jarix pleaded.

Vulzi, Sapphire thought to herself, that was adorable she needed to remember that one.

"Ohh right, sure we just so happen to be going that way anyway." 'good man' Sapphire thought to herself. She would hate to see the lady get away with any of this.

"Excellent, we can discuss the details later, first off. You lot tend to your friend and I'll take care of these disappointments" Hashaw responded.

"I'm keeping her tooth" Tom stated, in a fierce tone. Sapphire guessed he had a very itchy trigger finger right about now.

"Sure I don't care. Just don't take any more souvenirs." Hashaw dismissed him.

"Shame, could have used some white boots." He replied, turning back to Esmeralda.

Those who were not either tending to Esmeralda or keeping curious kids away set about tying up the three accompanying dragonettes and loading them onto Jarix. They would be placed under the watchful eye of Baron, who Sapphire guessed would be less than pleased to hear what had happened.

Two of them were just silent, clearly not quite sure what to do in a situation like this. Or possibly having taken the Lady's wisdom of, don't admit to anything before a court hearing, to heart. The last one had been apologizing profusely, as damn well he should, Sapphire thought. They were all taken away by Jarix along with the Lady.

Following that, Esmeralda had been moved to the infirmary, as carefully as they could manage. There she was fed more foul-smelling concoctions of Apuma's design. The improvement was a lot slower than the deterioration, but it was clearly working.

Sapphire had been asked to recount the sequence of events for everyone and now that Esmeralda was clearly going to be okay, at least she would be eventually. They even had a bit of a laugh at just how absurd stabbing somebody in the middle of a large hall full of people was. Quite a few jokes were had at the lady's expense or the bitch as Jackalope had so eloquently named her with Tom's approval. The news that all charges against them were going to be dropped anyway did sour Sapphire's mood a bit. She really wanted Essy to get the credit for it after all that happened. Still, since they had gone from having their charges dropped to now having charges pressed against the bitch, it hadn't all been for nothing.

Tom wasn't in a very good mood though, spending most of the time scowling at Esmeralda, even if he made it very clear he didn't believe she had done anything wrong. He had told them that Jarix had agreed to his whole teaching idea and joked that Shiva better fire up the forge cause she had the largest huntress crown ever to make.

Even Esmeralda had chuckled slightly at that notion, even if she sounded quite pained doing so. Kokashi did his best to calm her down again before she hurt herself. Quite how Tom had pulled that off Sapphire wasn't sure, but having a dragon along for the hunts rather than just having to feed it would certainly help a lot. Especially if they were sending people to the capitol, to testify.

When Tom had started asking questions like, if they had a pulling harness for a dragon, you know so Jarix could plow. Sapphire had damn near lost it, Raulf and Wiperna did. They all thought he had been joking. Sapphire had actually heard a story about a green dragon taking up fieldwork, as odd a combo as that seemed. But a blue dragon of the royal guard plowing fields. That was hilarious.

When she found out he was actually serious she laughed even harder. Perhaps it was more of a nervous reaction following having yet another close friend cheat death by a far too uncomfortable margin, but damn that was funny to her for some reason. Dakota and Nunuk both confirmed it thoughâ€¦ This was getting weirder and weirder.

"Right, where are they? Can't be that hard to find, they were supposed to be huge" Jacky grumbled as they trotted around the paddocks looking for this remarkably elusive tank. "But Tirexia went with Tom there… just need to find her then," she muttered to herself as she spotted a large set of red shoulders sticking up over the ridge of a tent. "That way!"
The group of girls all followed along, though with some complaining from Essy and Fengi about the muddy feet they were all getting.
"I thought we were going to get the beer and carry it back?" Ray asked cautiously. "I don't think the ones we got will do."
"No no, these are for us… actually, everyone grab another beer," Jacky went, stopping and setting down the four cardboard holders at a table, leaving them for the others to pick up. She grabbed two beers for herself and set off at a jog, trying hard not to spill anything which she sorta managed.
She rounded the corner and was confronted with both the dragons standing in the middle of the road that ran through the paddocks, surrounded by guys and girls in green. But the real prize was the tank sitting in one of the paddocks. "Oh my god. That is an actual fucking tank!" she let out, setting off at a sprint, one guy turning to face her with a friendly smile on his face, holding up his hand to shake.
A beat of her wings and a jump sent her sailing over his head, flipping around mid air, eyes locked on the beer, making sure to keep it in the plastic glasses. She came down with a thunk on the roof of the tank, standing up and looking around at where she was standing.
"What kind of tank is it? Is this all steel!? That's a machine gun, right?"
"Uhm… I mean it's a leopard… would you please come down from there?" the kind man responded, his gaze having followed her through the air. He was currently gawking at her, arm still held out for a shake.
"What? Why?"
"Just so you don't break anything," the very polite sounding guy replied, Jacky snapping her head up for a quick look around. It would seem she had gotten the attention of most of the people here, including Tom.
"Jacky. Please do as the nice man says. I'm sure he would be quite happy to show you around the tank if you ask nicely."
"But… it's literally a box of steel. How would I ever break it?"
"Cause it's full of delicate and very, very expensive equipment," Tom tried again in that calm diplomatic tone he so often used when she knew he just thought she was being a bit dumb.
"Fine fine," she let out annoyedly, hopping down to the ground and reaching out one of her two beers to the nice man as payment. "Wanna show me around?"
"I wanna see too," Fengi then let out as the younger woman came running over with just the one beer, Saph hot on her heels, Essy and Ray taking it more slowly coming up further behind.
"Uhm… It's a bit cramped in there… maybe one at a time?" the guy went, looking around at them and glancing down at the beer.
"Man up, Jens! Can't complain of being lonely and then stand up three girls that want a tour of your baby!" one of the larger, more burly guys laughed out, walking over. Tom just watched, clearly amused, before turning back to talking with some dude with more rank tabs on his shoulder, Tirexia paying attention to said conversation.
'Hmpf fine, leave me with the big burly soldier, see if I care,' Jacky muttered to herself, turning back to the small polite guy and pointedly ignoring the big loud one. "Sooo?"
"Oh sure… I'll give you the tour… Uhm. Maybe just stick your heads down through the hatches or something… you seem to have quite long necks."
"Yeah… we're dragonettes," Saph replied, seeming a little nonplussed.
"Right, yes, of course… I noticed," the guy muttered, sounding rather unsure of himself as he turned back to his tank, spreading his arms wide.
"This is a leopard 2 A 7 DK. That means it's Danish… Right. It's got 48 liter twin turbo diesel with 1500 horsepower and is armed with a 120 millimeter main gun that fires…"
'I am soo bribing that guy into letting me drive this thing… or maybe just ride along… I'll give him a hug or something, that should do… Hehehe Jacky, you are a genius.'
The nice man did indeed show them his baby in great detail, his earlier unease going dissappearing as soon as he had to talk tech rather than talk with three girls it would seem. It turned out he was the driver, with the loud guy from before being their loader. Jacky thought she might make a very good loader, but the driver wouldn't let her handle the shells for some odd reason. He did let her sit in the gunner's seat though, and he let her play with the controls. The tank wasn't on right now so they didn't do anything, but it was still awesome.
"Enjoying yourself down there?" an older sounding man questioned from above, Jacky looking up through the open hatch seeing the higher ranked guy Tom had been talking to looking down at her.
"Sir, yes sir!" she replied enthusiastically. "Are you the commander?"
"Yup, I see someone has taken my seat?" the man questioned, looking at where Saph was sitting. She just waved at him, seeming quite comfortable.
"So it's your tank?" Jacky asked curiously.
"Sure is," the commander chuckled heartily.
"Oooh, I wanna ask a favor," Jacky tried, getting ready to lay on the charm.
"Which is?"
"Could we ride along for the pull?"
"No, why would we want to give up those seats? and can't just have you sitting on the roof now, can we?" The commander chuckled shaking his head a little.
"Drink's on me afterwards?" Jacky attempted, doing her best to pull a Fengi, blinking a few times at the commander. "Pretty plea-"
"Done deal, welcome aboard," the commander replied, looking away while still standing above her. "Drinks on the tall one tonight, Per! I don't want you walking tomorrow morning."
"Sir, yes sir!" came from somewhere outside, Jacky turning to look at Saph who was just staring at her.
"Well I guess that's one way to make friends."
"This is gonna be expensive isn't it?"
"Mhmm."
***
The girls had come back to where Dakota and Shiva were sitting comfortably, bringing more beer as well as assuring her and Shiva that drinks for Jarix would be in order even if it would take some time.
The blue had returned to his spot behind them and promptly proceeded to take a nap. Quit why he thought trying to sleep near the track was a good idea was beyond Dakota, but he was soon wide awake again as the next class started, the machines only growing louder and louder as the sun started to set.
Then all of a sudden after the announcer spoke up about the next class, Fengi, Saph, and Jacky all had places to be, Dakota just lifted an eyebrow and looking at them confused as they got up and jogged off in a hurry, some of them —namely Jacky— swaying alarmingly by now.
"Where do you think they are going?" Dakota questioned, crossing her fingers that she wouldn't have to do anything about it. She had just gotten nice and comfy, not to mention they still had cold, fresh beer.
"Tirexia must be about to pull. Other than that I have no idea," Shiva replied disinterestedly. "But we might have to go grab ourselves a beer without them."
"Catastrophic."
"Quite."
"I could go get some," Ray spoke up, Dakota turning to look at the cripple, not sure if she wanted to accept that offer.
"... Why don't we drink ours then go together. I wouldn't mind finding a human or two to chat with either, surely there must be some interesting people mixed in here and there."
"Okay," Ray replied, glancing at the large crowd, clearly unsure if she wanted that particularly much. It didn't help that there was apparently a bit of a fight going on right now between a pair of very large bellied individuals.
"I'm sure the kids would love to say hi," Essy added with a warm smile, putting a hand on Ray's thigh.
"Oh… oh yeah, I guess we could do that," Ray replied, livening up a bit, clearly more happy with that solution.
***
It was mostly dark when Tirexia walked out onto the track, the huge dragon taking up nearly the full width of the track, standing at over six meters tall at the shoulder. She had apparently decided to turn off her belt for the weigh in, probably wanting to show off just how big she was. She had weighed in at 57 tons which, incredibly, still had her be the lighter one of the two when it came to pulling against the tank. Saph had asked Tom who he thought would win, and he hadn't been able to give a straight answer. He had just started mumbling about claws and traction and rubber pads on the tracks. Saph dind't really care, she was voting for Team Tank cause she and Jacky both got to sit in the turret, even if she had to give up the commander's seat for the man himself.
Fengi had somehow managed to convince the guy to let her hang on to the top of the tank despite some protests. She had pointed out how they were used to doing this with a living being with a tendency for sudden dives and corkscrews, which had done the trick. As well as a promise of getting to try the real thing on Jarix, something which Saph was quite sure the blue didn't know anything about.
They had all watched from the tank as Tirexia had started wandering down the track at a steady pace. Clearly not buying the whole 'get some speed' part, she simply marched on inexorably, all four clawed feet digging in equally.
"Looks like the red lizard has fourwheel drive," the loader had quipped, standing on top of the turret to better see. "Look at the fucking flames, guys? We're sure that's a living thing, right?!"
Saph looked up at the big display that was there to make it easier for people to see what was going on. In the dim light one could see the jets of flame shooting from her nostrils with every laboured breath as she hauled.
"What, you think she was only a red for show?" Jacky chuckled happily. "Just be happy she's not a green."
"Fucking hell, lad… Boss, we aren't allowed to pull the restrictors, right?"
"No, Per," the commander replied with a sigh. "Not like losing would lead to a war now, would it?"
"If it helps, I'm sure the king could be convinced to trade a dragon or two for a few tanks," Saph snickered, watching on as Tirexia's claws betrayed her, the dragon clearly having more strength but no way to use it as she came to a stop, all four legs still digging away, the track thoroughly ruined as far as Saph could tell.
"I'm sure he would. 90.1, guys, that's our mark. Try not to break anything."
***
"Oooh come on, Kevin, can't be that bad loosing firebreathing dragon," the loader, Per, laughed, patting the poor driver on the back.
The run had been a little uneventful if Fengi was being totally honest. The tank just rumbled along slowly to the point she couldn't really work out why they hadn't just all been sitting on the roof. It had lurched back and forth a bit as the driver changed gears or something, but in the end they had just come to a nice dignified stop as the tracks had started to spin, kicking up a bit of dirt. It had been nothing like the other tractors, that was for sure. But Jacky had promised drinks, and the tanker for the dragons had indeed arrived, so now it was party time.
There were still some far more boring tractors pulling away out on the track, but they had seen enough. When Fengi had worked out there was a dance floor, she knew what she would be doing with the evening. Aside from getting all the drinks. She had even managed to get Jacky and Saph to come along, both of them rather plastered.
There was no shortage of guys, but there were some girls too, Fengi even guessed they weren't too far off in terms of age, and one of them could definitely dance. The music was far too loud for talking, so they had just danced without a care in the world. It was quite nice really, even if Jacky did have to be restrained after knocking out a dude for some reason or another. It seems like it was all a misunderstanding, as five minutes later he had his picture taken with his head in her jaws.
They had all ducked for cover though as Tirexia let out a gust of flame over their heads perfectly timed with the odd song named *Feure Frie* they were playing. The old red had laughed so hard at their reaction that her bassy voice actually managed to cut through the speakers, lending a rather more sinister vibe to the music before she let loose again at the encore. The drunker people on the floor, that's to say those around Jacky, soon caught on. Spurred on by the gun nut they all got well and truely into shouting and or screaming along with the music. Fengi just shook her head before noticing that her dance partner was still cowering, hunched down low behind Fengi.
"Oh come on, she's been doing that for hundreds of years. She's not gonna grill anyone by accident," Fengi sighed, grabbing the human woman and helping her up. "Nothing to be afraid of," she carried on with a big smile as the woman staggered to her feet, not seeming that sure.
"Are you sure! She seems a little drunk to me!" Saph had shouted, holding her head close to Fengi to try and be heard. "And I'm pretty sure that hose she's got is just beer."
"Oh… heh, I'm sure it will be fine," Fengi chuckled suddenly a touch nervouse. Then she spied Jacky drunkenly making her way to the guy in charge of the music, clearly demanding his attention. 'Oh what now, Jacky?'
***
"Oooohhh, I know this song," Jarix giggled to himself, picking up the big metal glass of beer the nice people had made for him. Apparently they had just cut the lid off of something they called a keg, but oh well. They just kept filling it though, so he was gonna do his part. 'This bubbly stuff is amazing. It tickles soooo much,' he mused happily, starting to make his way over to the dance floor thingy, limping on three legs so he didn't have to put down his beer yet.
The dance floor was more of a platform with a bunch of lights and speakers strewn around, all under open sky so he wouldn't try stepping on it afraid he would break something. He had seen what Tirexia had pulled though and he was not to be outdone.
"Aaaoaa aoaaw Thunder… Thunder!" he chuckled before setting down the keg, getting ready. He was being very quiet and very sneaky. His blue blended in brilliantly with the darkness, in his mind, as he kept the humming along to a minimum, waiting for his moment to strike.
"Thunderstruck!" the music blared out as he turned his head skywards and let rip, trying not to giggle while firing as the deafening crackle of electricity rang out shooting towards the sky.
"Hehehe… oooh I got them there."
"JARIX!" some angry sounding woman let out, he started looking around trying to work out who that might have been or where it came from, just in case it was actually someone he should worry about. Who he spoted was Dakota and she was walking his way not looking very happy as Tirexia laughed her ass off. Back at the beer truck.
"Whaaaat? I didn't hit anything… I think."
"No shooting lightning bolts, okay?! There are too many people around, what if that's illegal?"
"They have laws against breath weapons here?"
"No.. I mean… Just don't, okay!?"
"Fiiiine," Jarix sighed, turning away from the dance floor, doing his best to look ashamed… for about three seconds till he could hear the encore coming on again.
"Jarix!... don't you dare."
Jarix just snickered mischievously, lowering down and getting ready to run as Dakota's face turned to one of horror. Jarix once more raised his head towards the sky and let loose as he set off running back towards the beer truck. "Thundeeeeeeeeer!"
Dakota had set off after him, but she had no chance as Jarix skidded to a stop, picking up the other keg which had now been filled and starting to drink. The crew of the truck looked on a touch nervous to him but oh well, the were probably just scared of his awesomeness or something.
He just about finished the keg as Dakota caught up and he set off again, running a ring around the angry sounding woman and heading back to where he had left his first keg. They couldn't fill his drinks for him if he didn't give the empty one back after all. As he stopped to pick it up, he made out up the sound of wing beats closing in. A slight twist of his head revealed Dakota coming in on the wing, heading right for his head. So he just lowered it down, causing her to go sailing past, swearing rather viciously, followed by a crashing sound as she impacted some sets of chairs and tables.
"oops…"
***
Dakota skidded to a stop underneath a wooden table, looking up at the rather bewildered human sitting at said table with beer and sausage in hand. She had known that having a crack at flying while inebriated wasn't smart, but dammit how else was she going to catch that damn dragon. Jarix for his part was just laughing his ass off at her misfortune, struggling to breathe and starting to wheeze.
"Nåååårrr. Her, have lidt medicin til sårende," the rather fat human bumbled incoherently. He was both drunk and speaking Danish. She stood no chance. But he did hold his glass down for her. She wasn't really sure she wanted to share a glass with the man, but fuck it,. As she reached up for the plastic cup he just pulled it away from her. She turned to stare at the man with a very annoyed expression. She was in no mood for this right now. She actually just wanted that damn beer.
"Ah ah. Åben op. Aaahhh," the guy replied, opening his mouth wide, seemingly demonstrating for her what to do.
"Oh for fuck sake…" she just grumbled in draconic, looking at him as meanly as she could manage. It did not seem to faze him one bit as he just held the cup there expectantly, opening and closing his mouth once more going "ahhhhhhr" like he was talking to a damn toddler. Things were not improved by Jarix still laughing to the point he was now writhing on the floor completely out of air.
'Well, someone finds it funny at least… Oh whatever, get arrested you damn dragon, see if I care,' Dakota finally relented as she just opened up, leaning her head back a bit and closing her eyes.
"Awwww god lille pige."
'I swear, if I ever work out what that means, I will probably be very angry,'
***
"HEEEY GUYS!" Jacky shouted out, holding up her empty cup and shaking it a bit. "What else we got?"
"Shots, shots, shots!" one of the drunken guys Per had found started chanting, soon being joined by more and more people around them.
"Like whiskey?!" she tried shouting into Per's ear, grabbing him by the hair and pulling his head closer. He didn't seem to mind as he just nodded.
"SURE! We have other shit too though!"
"Sweet!" Jacky just replied with a laugh, letting him go and turning to try and make her way to the bar, the rest of the group doing the same thing.
"Okay we can do sweet!" he just shouted out, pushing some people aside to take the lead, walking up to the bartender and starting to speak gibberish.
'Sweet whiskey?... that sounds strange?' Jacky thought to herself, having a look at the dance floor where the party had truly got going. She had started collecting more of those cap things, hanging them from her horns, and she also had someone's sandal up there now. She didn't really know where it had come from, but it was hers now.
The bartender started pouring some sort of bright liquids into the cutest little plastic glasses she had seen yet, and he was pouring a lot of them. Two sets of six as far as she could count right now. And there was blue, red, green, a few yellows, and a clear glass there. 'Oooh. A tasting board. Wait, is this on my bill?... I can't remember,' Jacky pondered, once more leaning in close to Per and shouting at him. "Did I pay for this?!"
"Fuck yeah you did! Start at that end, one at a time going this way. Ready?!"
"Fuck yeah," Jacky answered on pure instinct as other people had some of these shots poured for them, raising their glasses and looking around at each other expectantly.
Then Per started them off with some sort of chant. "Kan, Jacky! Kan Jacky drikke ud! Kan Jacky! Kan Jacky drike ud!"
She had no clue what it meant, but Per took the first shot and just slammed it down. So she did likewise.
It was fucking delicious, some kind of sweet yet sour apple taste. She could drink more of this stuff for sure, so she grabbed the second one right away and slammed it just as Per asked if she liked it. He quickly downed his own then had to try really hard to keep up as Jacky went down the line of sweet concoctions, the crowd cheering and taking their own shots.
When Jacky put down her last glass she felt all warm and fuzzy inside, and she could feel the sugar in there, it shouldn't be long before that worked its magic.
"Saph has to try this! I'll be right back!" she shouted at the group, going looking for her friend in the chaos easily enough leaving the boys behind through superior shoving.
She found her sitting at a bench just outside the dance floor along with Ray, chatting with some girls she guessed they had found.
"Saph! Saph! You have got to try these shot things!"
"We want shots?" one of the girls perked up, looking around at the others.
"Shots?" another one questioned as the third confirmed. "Shoooots wooohooo!"
Saph and Ray seemed a little confused but, they just shrugged looking at each other.
"I'll go get some, I know the bar guy. Wait here," the first girl replied, getting up and walking off, leaving Jacky a little conflicted. Did she stay here or go back to the floor? It was great fun in there.
Saph clearly picked up on it and patted the bench next to her that was now free. "Stay for the shots then you can go back."
"Great idea," Jacky agreed, pointing at her and going to sit down next to Saph. "Oh hi Dakota, how are you doing?"
***
'Oh dear,' was Ray's only response as Dakota sat down, placing her arms on the table and burying her head in them, the other girls making space for her. She was dripping with beer and muddy all over.
"I don't wanna talk about it."
"Want a drink or something? I think we're about to try shots," Saph tried hopefully. Ray reached over to give Dakota a pat on the arm.
"There there, it is only mud."
"Girl, you need a drink," one of the nice ladies they had sat down with offered, pushing a glass with some colorful liquid towards Dakota, who raised her head up just enough to peek at the glass.
"What's in it?"
The woman leant in a bit, holding a hand up to her mouth as if to whisper. "Vodka and Redbull. I heard you people like sugar, and between the two of us, it looks like you need a pick me up."
Dakota looked to Ray and Essy questioningly. Essy just shrugged, and Ray didn't know what to say.
"I- I haven't had one, I don't know what it tastes like. I got a… no- nohiiito. I think."
"Mojito!" the three human girls shrieked out in unison. "That one is very good too. But you need this one, I promise you," the very loudly whispering woman reassured, pushing the glass a bit closer.
Dakota looked at the woman then back to the drink once or twice then sat up proper in her seat, forcing on a smile and reaching for the glass. "Thanks."
'I hope Tom won't be mad we didn't ask him…'
"Essy, where is Tom?" Ray questioned, leaning in a bit closer to Essy.
"I think he's with Shiva, Tirexia, and the tanker folk. He seemed to get along with them well. Maybe they know each other? I know Tirexia is mostly just annoying Jarix."
"Ooohhh… Yeah, that would make sense," Ray agreed, nodding excessively before going back for a sip of her own very lovely drink. It was much better than the beer, even if one did have to watch it with the sugar.
***
"Oooooh yeah! I've killed dragons, darklings, night terrors, fucking everything. I love guns and Tom showed me a bike once. Seems fucking awesome. Any of you got one?" Jacky questioned, looking around at the group of guys having once more made it back after yet more shots. She would definitely be lying if she said she wasn't enjoying the attention just a little. The alcohol probably helped, but this had to be what Saph used to feel like when she was a racer.
They had gotten plenty of attention coming here thus far of course, but that was more just gawking, the fact they were a novelty, alien even. But this wasn't that. This was admiration, and it was fun! That and she was very sloshed by now. Those cute little shot thingies just tasted so lovely. And they gave her the jitters too. She was fucking hyper right now.
She was about to launch into the epic retelling of how she, Jackalope furlong, slayer of dragons and layer of humans had brought low a red dragon all by herself with no help at all when Dakota of all people came storming onto the dancefloor hauling a very confused looking Fengi after her, who didn't seem to quite get what was going on.
"What theeee…. Huh?" Jacky questioned gawkig, tilting her head a little, drink going with as she started to pour it out on the floor. One of the guys was at least kind enough to take her drink and put it on the table for her.
Dakota ushered Fengi to do some dance moves for some reason, and then proceed to copy happily, a massive grin on her face, teeth on full display, as she went to town with more enthusiasm than even Fengi.
"Someone's having fun," Per chuckled, leaning  back in his chair staring at the two dragonettes as they really got going. Some young human man came up, seemingly wanting in, and started spinning around on the floor. Fengi looked at him a touch confused, probably trying to work out what he was doing or something. Dakota just had a go at it with little success. Then she tried again… and again… and again. "Well I guess we know why she's gotten so muddy then. Yoo is someone filming?"
"Yup," someone snickered from somewhere. "This is sooo going on youtube, bro."
Jacky looked down to see if something had gotten in her drink, finding her hand empty. 'Hmmm… where did it go?... hmmmm….'
"Think someone gave her drugs or something?" one of the guys asked, sounding a little worried.
"Naaah man, it's the sugar shit. I bet you she got an energy drink."
"What's that?" Jacky asked, perking up. That sounded VERY interesting.
One trip to the bar later and this strange mystery drink had been procured, she downed it in one go obviously. It was nice and bubbly, sweet, and tasted quite nice. She had no clue what of though. As she pondered the taste and confirmed that she felt just fine to the worried of one of the guys, she started feeling this very strange tickling. She had already been quite hyper if she was being totally honest, but this shit was different.
"Hey, you. Per, big guy. Arm wrestle now!" Jacky growled with a cruel smile on her face, pointing at the table. She had wanted to get around to that at some point, so why not now. Per was big, his shoulders were even wider than hers and his arms were thicker. So she would just cheat obviously. But she wanted to see what this strange tingling stuff did.
When she promptly slammed Per's poor hand into the table with enough force to send him off the bench he was sitting on, she just stared at her own hand in awe, a massive shiteating grin starting to spread across her face as the others either stared in awe or went to help poor Per, who was struggling to work out what just happened.
"Oh I wanna start a fight right now!"
"Woo woo woo, Let's try not to kill anyone."
"Right, sorry! What about pulling something, that's what this place is for!"
"I mean we could try that, I guess?" the careful guy replied, not seeming overly confident, shrinking a little every time her eyes flicked to him. 'Heh, he's scared… fucking adorable.'
***
"Tom?... Why is Jacky pulling around an upside down table with five guys and a dog on it?" the tank commander questioned as they all stared at the odd sight coming by ever so slowly. Jacky was really putting her back into it to the point Tom was wondering if maybe she had felt left out earlier when the dragons had a go at it. Eyes shining bright too in the dim light of the various lights dotted around the arena.
"I have no idea…" Tom admitted, wondering if he really wanted to know. He hadn't been scared of some guy running off with his girlfriend. Quite the opposite really, he had been mostly worried about what would happen to the poor guy who tried his luck. But of all the ways Jacky had showed off before, this had to be the strangest for sure. 'At least she didn't try flying,' Tom sighed to himself, wondering if perhaps some oversight was needed. There had been both Dakota, and Essy to try and keep things calm. Surely they didn't need him too.
Shiva just let out a very long and very disappointed sigh as she too stared, Jacky slowly moving past them and up the now disused clay track. "Does that even count as embarrassing herself?"
"I-I mean... S-She's doing it," Jarix slurred out, head swaying from side to side.
"Awwwww. The little baby blue has gotten all wooozey," Tirexia said like she was talking to a baby, stroking the side of Jarix's neck with the back of a single claw. "Is it time for bed yet?"
Jarix didn't respond to her, instead just looking down at Tom indignantly. "See Tom? \*Hiccup\* This is what I get for everything I have done… It's not very dige-... dine-... digenefide," he finally got out, Tom trying his best not to chuckle. The tank commander just blinked a few times, staring at the two dragons as Kevin the driver scratched the back of his neck. "This is not how I envisioned this moment. Not at all."
"You'll get used to it," Tom chuckled, shaking his head a bit. "At least it's never boring."
